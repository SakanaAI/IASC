In section {section_number} we will consider the verbal (verb) category of
head marking.

Languages may mark information about nominal arguments of the verb on the verb
itself. A language may have no head marking, or mark various nominal
arguments. This can happen even when the language has no case marking on nouns.

For a Nominative-Accusative language the head might be marked as follows:

VNOM:  Nominative. E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-VNOM"
VACC:  Accusative. E.g. "see the dog" -> "see-VACC dog"
VDAT:  Dative. E.g. "give to the dog " -> "give-VDAT dog"

Note the "V" prefix on the categories to distinguish them from nominal case marking.

A language might mark just Nominative, Nominative and Accusative, or all three.

Similarly for Ergative-Absolutive languages we would find:

VERG:  Ergative. E.g. "John eats something" -> "John eat-VERG"
VABS:  Absolutive. E.g. "see the dog" -> "see-VABS dog";  "John leaves" -> "John leave-VABS"

(We omit dative since that behaves the same as above.)

Please note the following important point: you should only head-mark a verb for
an argument if the verb really has the argument in question. Thus

"leave-PRES-VERG-VABS John-ABS"

where "John" is the subject would be WRONG, because the verb "leave" does not
have an Ergative argument in this case!!!

Our language marks "{{head_marking}}".
