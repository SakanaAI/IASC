In section {section_number} we will consider classifiers that go with numbers,
and mark the type of noun associated with the number.

There are a variety of classifier systems, with some languages like Japanese, or
Chinese, having dozens of classifiers. Classifiers are usually semantically
based, depending on visual or taxonomic features of the noun's meaning.

A typical classifier system might include:

CLFLAT:	  Used with flat objects like paper:		  three CLFLAT paper   "3 pieces of paper"
CLROUND:  Used with round objects like coins:		  twenty CLROUND coin  "20 coins"
CLLONG:	  Used with long objects like string, or rivers:  one CLLONG string "1 piece of string"
CLANIMAL: Used with animals:				  two CLANIMAL cow  "2 cows"

Since the set of possible classifiers is rather open ended, I am simply going to
tell you if our language (a) HAS_CLASSIFIERS or (b) NONE (= no classifiers). If
it HAS_CLASSIFIERS, then you should make up reasonable classifiers to use when
nouns are modified by numbers. Base your classifier system on what you know
about classifiers in languages that you have read about. The classifier should
be introduced between the noun and the number in your translation.

For our language: "{{numeral_classifier}}".
