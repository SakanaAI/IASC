In section {section_number} we will consider the nominal (noun) category of
number marking.

A language may have no number marking, or it may distinguish:

SING: Singular	(one)
PLUR: Plural    (more than one)
DUAL: Dual      (exactly two)

So in a language with "SING PLUR" marking, one would mark "cat" as "cat-SING"
and "cats" as "cat-PLUR".  If the language has "SING PLUR DUAL" marking, then
"two cats" is "cat-DUAL" and "cat-PLUR" means "three or more cats". If the
language has "NONE", then leave the noun unmarked.

Our language has: "{{number_marking}}".
