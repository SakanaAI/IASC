In section {section_number} we will consider the inclusive-exclusive distinction
which applies in particular to the First Person Plural pronoun "we", and
anything that agrees with it (such as a verb).

In English "we" is ambiguous as to whether or not it includes the listener. On
the other hand, many languages distinguish between

INCL1PL	  Inclusive First Person Plural	   "we" including the listener
EXCL1PL	  Exclusive First Person Plural	   "we" excluding the listener

Thus if we translate:

"we like you"

into a language with the INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE distinction, we would translate
"we" here as "EXCL1PL", since it is clear from the meaning that in this case
"we" does not include the listener. On the other hand

"we all agree"

spoken to a group of people, would have "we" translated as "INCL1PL".

Note that the inclusive-exclusive distinction should ONLY be applied to
first-person plural. For example "3SGEXCL" makes no sense.

If the language we will develop has INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE distinction, then you
will need to pay attention to how to translate "we". Otherwise if it is "NONE",
then "we" can just be translated as "we".

Our language has: "{{inclusive_exclusive}}".
