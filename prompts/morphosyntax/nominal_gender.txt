In section {section_number} we will consider the nominal (noun) category of
gender.

Many languages have grammatical gender, as distinct from the natural gender
exhibited in English. Well-known examples include Masculine-Feminine gender
systems of Romance languages; the Masculine-Feminine-Neuter system of German or
Russian; or the Common-Neuter system in Dutch or in some Scandinavian
languages. Many languages of Africa have non-sex-based gender systems. Since
sex-based systems are the majority (75% of the sample of gendered languages in
the World Atlas of Language Structures), we will assume a gender-based
system. Options are:

MASC:	Masculine:	E.g. John-MASC, pumpkin-MASC
FEM:	Feminine:	E.g. Sally-FEM, sea-FEM
NEUT:	Neuter:		E.g. snake-NEUT
COMM:	Common gender:	E.g. John-COMM, Sally-COMM

The following gendered systems are possible:

1. MASC, FEM
2. MASC, FEM, NEUT
3. COMMON, NEUT

For personal names, gender appropriate affixes should be chosen. For common
nouns, since English does not have gender, you will have to make a decision as
to what gender to assign to the noun: be creative, but be consistent!

In many languages that have gender, adjectives may agree in gender with nouns
they modify or are predicated of.

As with other affixes, we assume that gender affixes can occur as either
suffixes or prefixes, so pay attention to the position of the "-".
