In section {section_number} we will consider the verbal (verb) category of
person agreement.

Languages may mark person agreement on verbs for arguments such as subjects,
objects or indirect objects.  By person, we mean things like first (1st) person
singular for "I", second (2nd) person singular for "thou", third (3rd) person
plural for "they" and so forth.

A language might mark nominative subject agreement on the verb for example:

1SGNOM:	   1st person singular nominative: E.g. "I leave" -> "I leave-1SGNOM"
2SGNOM:	   2nd person singular nominative: E.g. "thou leavest" -> "thou leave-2SGNOM"
3SGNOM:	   3rd person singular nominative: E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-3SGNOM"
1PLNOM:	   1st person plural nominative:   E.g. "we leave" -> "we leave-1PLNOM"
2PLNOM:	   2nd person plural nominative:   E.g. "ye leave" -> "ye leave-2PLNOM"
3PLNOM:	   3rd person plural nominative:   E.g. "John and Mary leave" -> "John and Mary leave-3PLNOM"

Similarly the language might mark accusative objects with person agreement or
indirect objects. Just a couple of examples:

1SGACC:	   1st person singular accusative: E.g. "leave me" -> "leave-1SGACC me"
1SGDAT:	   1st person singular dative:     E.g. "give to me" -> "give-1SGDAT me"

A language might mark just Nominative, Nominative and Accusative, or all three.

In an Ergative-Absolutive language, 1SGERG, for example, would mark the
situation where I am engaging in a transitive action, 1SGABS would obtain if
the action is intransitive, or if I am the direct object of the action:

1SGERG:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I see" -> "I see-1SGERG"
1SGABS:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I run" -> "I run-1SGABS"; "see me" -> "see-1SGABS me"

Please note the following important point: you should only head-mark a verb for
an argument if the verb really has the argument in question. Thus

"I leave-PRES-3SGERG-3SGABS John-ABS"

where "John" is the subject would be WRONG, because the verb "leave" does not
have an Ergative argument in this case!!!

Note that we use the same variable for head_marking and
verbal_person_agreement.
