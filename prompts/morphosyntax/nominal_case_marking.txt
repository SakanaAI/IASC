In section {section_number} we will consider the nominal (noun) category of
case marking.

First you need to decide whether the language is Nominative-Accusative or
Ergative-Absolutive. In a Nominative-Accusative language the subject of a
sentence is marked Nominative and the direct object is Accusative:

John-NOM saw Mary-ACC
John-NOM

In an Ergative-Absolutive language, the subject of a transitive sentence is
marked Ergative, whereas objects of transitive sentences and subjects of
intransitive sentences are marked Absolutive

John-ERG saw Mary-ABS
John-ABS

Beyond these two, there is a more-or-less universal hierarchy of cases with
earlier ones in the following list being more likely than later ones:

GEN:	Genitive. E.g. "John's book" -> "John-GEN book"
DAT:	Dative. E.g. "gave to John" -> "gave John-DAT"
LOC:	Locative: E.g. "in Rome" -> "Rome-LOC"
ABL:	Ablative: E.g. "by Rome"/"with Rome" -> "Rome-ABL"
INS:	Instrumental: E.g. "with glue" -> "glue-INS"

Our language has "{{case_marking}}" case marking.
