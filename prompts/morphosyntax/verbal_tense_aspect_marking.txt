In section {section_number} we will consider the verbal (verb) category of
tense and aspect.

On the tense front, languages may distinguish the following:

PRES:    Present tense. E.g. "goes" -> "go-PRES"
PAST:    Past tense. E.g. "went" -> "go-PAST"
FUT:	 Future tense. E.g. "will go" -> "go-FUT"
REMPAST: Remote past. E.g. "went (a long time ago)" -> "go-REMPAST"

A language may also not mark for tense at all.

When it comes to aspect, languages may not mark aspect at all, or they may
distinguish between Perfective and Imperfective aspect:

IMPF: Imperfective.	       E.g. "went" -> "go-IMPF"
PERF: Perfective.	       E.g. "has gone" -> "go-PERF"

A language may have both tense and aspect marking, in which case you should mark
both on the verb. For example,

"will have gone" -> "go-FUT-PERF"
"had gone"       -> "go-PAST-PERF"
"will go"        -> "go-FUT-IMPF

Our language marks "{{tense_aspect}}".
