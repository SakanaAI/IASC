In this version we attempt to cumulate the morphosyntactic information, starting
with word order.

Rather than try to do the transformations in one step, ask the model to do one
thing at a time --- manipulate the word order, add case marking, and so forth.

Each time we give instructions about starting with an English original, and
transforming it into the structure of the target language. For all subsequent
steps beyond the first step, we feed it the original English text, and the most
recent transformation, and tell it to construct its updated translation on the
basis of the most recent transformation.

-->

We are going to develop a 'translator' for our ConLang, which will 'translate' from English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but may mark them with additional morphosyntactic information, and where the English phrases may be reordered.

Morphosyntactic markers may show up as affixes (prefixes or suffixes) or words (prepositional or postpositional). Our convention for marking suffixes is to place a dash before the affix, and for prefixes to place a dash after the affix:

"-XXX" is a suffix: when one attaches "-XXX" to "word" one gets "word-XXX"
"XXX-" is a prefix: when one attaches "XXX-" to "word" one gets "XXX-word"

In this portion we will consider the nominal (noun) category of case marking.

In the description below we will use suffixes for the sake of example, but a language may use either suffixes or prefixes to mark this information.

First you need to decide whether the language is Nominative-Accusative or Ergative-Absolutive.

Consider the English original sentences:

"John saw Mary"
"John left"

In a Nominative-Accusative language the subject of a sentence is marked Nominative ("NOM") and the direct object is Accusative ("ACC"). If cases are marked as suffixes, then "John" would be marked as "John-NOM" in both cases and
Mary as "Mary-ACC":

"John-NOM saw Mary-ACC"
"John-NOM left"

In an Ergative-Absolutive language, the subject of a transitive sentence is marked Ergative ("ERG"), whereas objects of transitive sentences and subjects of intransitive sentences are marked Absolutive ("ABS"). Again, assuming these are marked as suffixes, then in our example sentences above we would have:

"John-ERG saw Mary-ABS"
"John-ABS"

Beyond these two, there is a more-or-less universal hierarchy of cases with earlier ones in the following list being more likely than later ones:

GEN:	Genitive. E.g. "John's book" -> "John-GEN book"
DAT:	Dative. E.g. "gave to John" -> "gave John-DAT"
LOC:	Locative: E.g. "in Rome" -> "Rome-LOC"
ABL:	Ablative: E.g. "by Rome"/"with Rome" -> "Rome-ABL"
INS:	Instrumental: E.g. "with glue" -> "glue-INS"

Languages may also mark the oblique argument and the object of an adposition with a specific case-marking. For example, if a language marks such NPs with a genitive suffix, we will have:

"for John" -> "for John-GEN"
"last night" -> "last-GEN night-GEN".

Languages may also not mark case at all, in which case we specify "NONE".

Our language has "{{case_marking}}" case marking, and it is marked by "{{case_marking_strategy}}".
In our language, oblique noun phrases are marked by "{{oblique_case_marking}}".

If the above case marking is not "NONE", then be sure to pay attention to whether the case markers are specified as prefixes or suffixes.

Your task is to 'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below. This text is itself a translation of an original text that you did on the previous round. This original text is given under ORIGINAL TEXT for your reference, but you should use the SAMPLE TEXT as the starting point.

Any pronouns that you case mark should be presented in their lemma form with the case marking: e.g., "our-GEN" should become "we-GEN".

<!-- TODO(rws): Possibly omit the following instruction. -->
<!-- (ct): Omitted. Definiteness will be handled by another feature.
Do not mark the articles "the" or "a" but rather omit these entirely. -->

Do not change any affixes that have been added on a previous phase.

Place a period at the end of each sentence, as in the original text. Don't forget to translate the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper names, which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", "We" would become "we", but "John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE SAMPLE TEXT. THAT IS IF THE SAMPLE TEXT HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES, AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

# ORIGINAL TEXT BEGINS
{{original_text}}
# ORIGINAL TEXT ENDS

# SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
