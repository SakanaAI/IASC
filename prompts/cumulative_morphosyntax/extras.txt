<!--

In this version we attempt to cumulate the morphosyntactic information, starting
with word order.

Rather than try to do the transformations in one step, ask the model to do one
thing at a time --- manipulate the word order, add case marking, and so forth.

Each time we give instructions about starting with an English original, and
transforming it into the structure of the target language. For all subsequent
steps beyond the first step, we feed it the original English text, and the most
recent transformation, and tell it to construct its updated translation on the
basis of the most recent transformation.

-->

We are going to develop a 'translator' for our ConLang, which will 'translate'
from English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words,
but may mark them with additional morphosyntactic information, and where the
English phrases may be reordered.

Morphosyntactic markers may show up as prefixes or suffixes. Our convention for
marking suffixes is to place a dash before the affix, and for prefixes to place
a dash after the affix:

"-XXX" is a suffix: when one attaches "-XXX" to "word" one gets "word-XXX"

"XXX-" is a prefix: when one attaches "XXX-" to "word" one gets "XXX-word"

By this stage you have already developed various morphosyntactic information
encoded as affixes for the target language. In this stage, take a look at the
text as described below, and see if there are any other sorts of information
that might be encoded as affixes. To do this, consider your knowledge of
linguistics, and what kinds of information languages may encode.

Your task is to 'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below. This text is
itself a translation of an original text that you did on the previous
round. This original text is given under ORIGINAL TEXT for your reference, but
you should use the SAMPLE TEXT as the starting point.

Please be sure to give content words in their lemma (dictionary) form,
except that you shouldn't remove negative affixes like "n't" from modal verbs!

<!-- TODO(rws): Possibly omit the following instruction. -->
Do not mark the articles "the" or "a" but rather omit these entirely.

Do not change any affixes that have been added on a previous phase.

Place a period at the end of each sentence, as in the original text. Don't
forget to translate the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words,
except proper names, which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become
"man", "We" would become "we", but "John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE SAMPLE TEXT. THAT
IS IF THE SAMPLE TEXT HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES,
AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN
THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

Please put your response within <OUTPUT></OUTPUT> tags. In your summary to
appear OUTSIDE the <OUTPUT> tags, please explain what additional information you
decided to encode using affixes.
