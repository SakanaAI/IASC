We are going to develop a 'translator' for our ConLang, which will 'translate' from English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but may mark them with additional morphosyntactic information, and where the English phrases may be reordered.

Morphosyntactic markers may show up as affixes or separate words. For affixes, our convention for marking suffixes is to place a dash before the affix, and for prefixes to place a dash after the affix:

"-XXX" is a suffix: when one attaches "-XXX" to "word" one gets "word-XXX"
"XXX-" is prefix: when one attaches "XXX-" to "word" one gets "XXX-word"

In this stage we will consider pro-drop. Pro-drop (short for pronoun-dropping) is a linguistic phenomenon where subject pronouns (and sometimes other pronouns) can be omitted because their reference is recoverable from context, typically through verb inflection or discourse.

In the description below we will use suffixes for the sake of example, but a language may use either suffixes or prefixes to mark this information.

Consider the following example sentence: "He eats breakfast." Suppose that a language marks the person and number agreement on the verb, and it is a pro-drop language. Then, the example sentence would be: "eat-PRES-3SG breakfast."

Our language is a "{{pro_drop}}" language.

Your task is to 'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below. This text is itself a translation of an original text that you did on the previous round. This original text is given under ORIGINAL TEXT for your reference, but you should use the SAMPLE TEXT as the starting point.

Do not change any affixes that have been added on a previous phase.

Place a period at the end of each sentence, as in the original text. Don't forget to translate the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper names, which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", "We" would become "we", but "John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE SAMPLE TEXT. THAT IS IF THE SAMPLE TEXT HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES, AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

# ORIGINAL TEXT BEGINS
{{original_text}}
# ORIGINAL TEXT ENDS

# SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
{{previous_translation}}
# SAMPLE TEXT ENDS

Please put your response within <OUTPUT></OUTPUT> tags.
