In this version we attempt to cumulate the morphosyntactic information, starting
with word order.

Rather than try to do the transformations in one step, ask the model to do one
thing at a time --- manipulate the word order, add case marking, and so forth.

Each time we give instructions about starting with an English original, and
transforming it into the structure of the target language. For all subsequent
steps beyond the first step, we feed it the original English text, and the most
recent transformation, and tell it to construct its updated translation on the
basis of the most recent transformation.

-->

We are going to develop a 'translator' for our ConLang, which will 'translate' from English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but may mark them with additional morpholosyntactic information, and where the English phrases may be reordered.

<subject_object_verb>
We start with word order, where we will consider the main order of the sentence in terms of Subject (S), Object (O) and Verb (V).

If the original English sentence is

"Animals drink water"

then depending on the word order specification in the lefthand column, one would transform the sentence as in the righthand column:

VSO: "drink animals water"
SVO: "animals drink water"
SOV: "animals water drink"
VOS: "drink water animals"
OVS: "water drink animals"
OSV: "water animals drink"
</subject_object_verb>

<noun_adjective>
Next, we consider the order of adjectives and nouns, which may be Noun-Adjective ("NA") or Adjective-Noun ("AN"). If the original English phrase is

"red book"

then depending on the word order specification in the lefthand column, one would transform the sentence as in the righthand column:

NA: "book red"
AN: "red book"
</noun_adjective>

<possessivepronoun_noun>
Next, we consider the order of possessive pronouns and nouns, which may be Possessive Pronoun-Noun ("PossN") or Noun-Possessive Pronoun ("NPoss"). If the original English phrase is

"my book"

then, depending on the word order specification in the lefthand column, one would transform the sentence as in the right column:

PossN: "my book"
NPoss: "book my"
</possessivepronoun_noun>

<numeral_noun>
Next, we consider the order numerals and nouns, which may be Numeral-Noun ("NumN") or Noun-Numeral ("NNum"). If the original English phrase is

"three books"

then, depending on the word order specification in the lefthand column, onw would transform the sentence as in the right column:

NumN: "three books"
NNum: "books three"
</numeral_noun>

<adposition_noun>
Finally we consider the ordering of adpositions and nouns, which may be Preposition-Noun ("PN") or Noun-Postposition ("NP").  If the original English phrase is

"in Paris"

then depending on the word order specification in the lefthand column, one would transform the sentence as in the righthand column:

PN: "in Paris"
NP: "Paris in"
</adposition_noun>

The language we want to develop has:

"{{main_word_order}}" main word order.
"{{adj_noun_word_order}}" adjective-noun word order.
"{{posspron_noun_word_order}}" possessive pronoun-noun word order.
"{{numeral_noun}}" numeral-noun word order.
"{{adposition_noun_word_order}}" adposition-noun word order.

Your task is to 'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below reordering words and phrases as needed to match the word order specifications given above.

Place a period at the end of each sentence, as in the original text. Don't forget to translate the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper names, which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", "We" would become "we", but "John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE SAMPLE TEXT. THAT IS IF THE SAMPLE TEXT HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES, AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

# SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
{{original_text}}
# SAMPLE TEXT ENDS

Please put your response within <OUTPUT></OUTPUT> tags.
