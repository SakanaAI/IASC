We are going to develop a 'translator' for our ConLang, which will 'translate' from English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but may mark them with additional morphosyntactic information, and where the English phrases may be reordered.

Morphosyntactic markers may show up as affixes or separate words. For affixes, our convention for marking suffixes is to place a dash before the affix, and for prefixes to place a dash after the affix:

"-XXX" is a suffix: when one attaches "-XXX" to "word" one gets "word-XXX"
"XXX-" is prefix: when one attaches "XXX-" to "word" one gets "XXX-word"

In this stage we will consider the verbal category of mood.
A grammatical mood is a verb feature that expresses the speaker’s attitude toward the action, event, or state described by the verb.

In the description below we will use suffixes for the sake of example, but a language may use either suffixes or prefixes to mark this information.

On the tense front, languages may distinguish the following:

IND:    Indicative mood. E.g. "you go to school." -> "you go-IND to school."
IMP:    Imperative mood. E.g. "Go to school!" -> "go-IMP to school!"
SUB:    Subjunctive mood. E.g. "(I hope that) you go to school." -> "you go-SUB to school."
COND:   Conditional mood. E.g. "(If you had a chance,) you would go to school." -> " "you go-COND to school."

A language may also not mark for mood at all.

Our language marks "{{mood}}", and mood is marked by "{{mood_marking_strategy}}".

If the above specification for tense/aspect is not "NONE", then be sure to pay attention to whether the tense/aspect markers are specified as prefixes or suffixes.

Your task is to 'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below. This text is itself a translation of an original text that you did on the previous round. This original text is given under ORIGINAL TEXT for your reference, but you should use the SAMPLE TEXT as the starting point.

Any verbs you mark for tense should have tense information removed and thus appear in their lemma form, except that you shouldn't remove negative affixes like "n't" from modal verbs!  Thus "ate-PAST" would become "eat-PAST".

Do not change any affixes that have been added on a previous phase.

Place a period at the end of each sentence, as in the original text. Don't forget to translate the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper names, which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", "We" would become "we", but "John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE SAMPLE TEXT. THAT IS IF THE SAMPLE TEXT HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES, AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

# ORIGINAL TEXT BEGINS
