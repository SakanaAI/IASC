<INSTRUCTIONS>

I'd like you to write me {{number_of_sentences}} example English sentences that illustrate
basic core grammatical relations, namely SUBJECT, OBJECT and INDIRECT
OBJECT. Use a variety of both TRANSITIVE and INTRANSITIVE verbs.

An example that illustrates SUBJECT, OBJECT and INDIRECT OBJECT in a TRANSITIVE
sentence might be:

"John gave the book to Mary."

An example with an INTRANSITIVE sentence might be:

"John left yesterday."
