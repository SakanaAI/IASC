<INSTRUCTIONS>

I'd like you to write me {{number_of_sentences}} example English sentences that illustrate
the difference between the INCLUSIVE and EXCLUSIVE interpretations of "we"/"us".
INCLUSIVE "we" is interpreted as including the listener, whereas EXCLUSIVE "we",
excludes the listener.  English does not mark this distinction grammatically,
but one can infer from the context, usually, which one is meant. Thus:

INCLUSIVE

"We need to leave now, so please get your coat."
"You are a valued member of our company."

EXCLUSIVE

"We didn't ask you to do that."
"You were pretty mean to us."

Try to make your examples as clear as you can in terms of which interpretation
(INCLUSIVE or EXCLUSIVE) is the most natural one.
