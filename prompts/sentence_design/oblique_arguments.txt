<INSTRUCTIONS>

I'd like you to write me {{number_of_sentences}} example English sentences that illustrate
various non-core grammatical relations, including GENITIVE (i.e. POSSESSIVE),
LOCATIVE, INSTRUMENTAL and ABLATIVE (typically meaning motion away from something).

Example sentences that illustrate each of these might be:

GENITIVE:

"I borrowed John's book."

LOCATIVE:

"Mary lived in Rome."

INSTRUMENTAL:

"He cut the cucumber with scissors."

ABLATIVE:

"He left from the station this morning."
