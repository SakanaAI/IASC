<INSTRUCTIONS>

I'd like you to write me {{number_of_sentences}} example English sentences that illustrate
NUMBER in nouns, in particular SINGULAR, DUAL and PLURAL. English of course does
not specifically mark DUAL, but in that case you would use "two" with the plural
of the noun.

Examples follow:

SINGULAR:

"The man arrived yesterday."

DUAL:

"I saw two sheep."

PLURAL:

"The dogs ran after the ball."
