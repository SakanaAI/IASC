<INSTRUCTIONS>
The first phase in creating any ConLang is to create a set of words for the
language. Typically this involves defining the phoneme set, including some
information about their relative frequency as well as their phoneme classes
(consonant, vowel, tone) and phonetic features.

Then one needs to define a set of morpheme templates, which define possible
morpheme shapes. This could be as simple as "CVC" for a language that allows CVC
syllables, to something more complex like "CCVC.CCVC" for languages that allow
disyllabic morphemes with each syllable of the form "CCVC".

In the last phase you constructed a program to generate morphemes in a language
that has phonotactics similar to {{language}}.  The code you wrote last time was
as follows:

# BEGIN PREVIOUS CODE
{{previous_code}}
# END PREVIOUS CODE

When I run this program with 100 outputs, this is a sample I get:

# BEGIN SAMPLE
{{output_sample}}
# END SAMPLE

Please check this output and see if there are any words that look
phonotactically odd. In particular are there words or syllables that begin with
rather unlikely consonant sequences. For example, cross-linguistically, the
following syllables have strange onsets since they begin with consonant
sequences, or end with consonant sequences that are unlikely onsets or codas
given the Sonority Hierarchy:

p d ɛ d p
m d ɔʏ t
t n ɔ t

Can you improve the program to not output syllables that look like this? Also,
if you notice a bug in your code so that it seems only to be producing
monosyllables, please fix that.

There may also be phonemes that are particularly characteristic of the language
that are missing from your previous code, or ones that should not be
there. Please also check for that.

As before, your code should be implemented as a standalone Python program that
takes as a command-line argument the number of morpheme forms to generate. For
example:

python3 your_program.py --num_morphemes 100

would randomly generate 100 morphemes.

Within each morpheme, please place spaces between every phoneme, i.e.

"o k a tʃ a"

rather than

"okatʃa"

MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ADD ANY TABLES OF CLUSTERS OF PHONEMES THAT THESE ALSO
INCLUDE SPACES BETWEEN THE PHONEMES.

Your code should include two global dictionaries, one named "consonants" and the
other named "vowels". These should contain the phonemes mapped to their relative
frequencies. Thus for example, a partial consonant dictionary might include:

consonants = {"m": 3, "n": 7 ...}

Please make sure you include needed functions and imports in your code.

Finally, place your resulting code in the block <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>.
PLEASE DO NOT PUT ANYTHING EXCEPT THE PYTHON CODE WITHIN THIS BLOCK.

This is iteration {{which_iteration}} out of {{num_iterations}} iterations on
this task. If you are getting close to the end and/or if you believe that your
previous code is doing a reasonable job, please do NOT provide a new program,
but instead respond as follows:

<OUTPUT>NO CHANGES TO MAKE.</OUTPUT>

This task will depend on your deep knowledge of linguistics, and Python
programming.  Good luck!
