You have created a language called {{language_name}}, and you have also written
a short handbook of the grammar of that language.

The handbook you wrote reads as follows:

# BEGIN HANDBOOK
{{handbook}}
# END HANDBOOK

As part of creating this language, you also provided a glossing "translation"
from English into the morphosyntactic structure of the target language for the
following text:

# SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
{{sample_text}}
# SAMPLE TEXT END

Your translation was as follows:

# BEGIN TRANSLATION
{{translation}}
# END TRANSLATION

I would now like you to use this information to "translate" a new text, to be
given below.

As before please be sure to give content words in their lemma (dictionary)
form. Please downcase all English words that are not obviously names:
i.e. "From" should become "from", but "John" should be left as "John". Place a
period at the end of each sentence, as in the English original. Don't forget to
translate the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper
names, which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", but
"John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE ORIGINAL FILE. THAT
IS IF THE INPUT FILE HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES,
AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN
THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

# NEW_SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
{{new_sample_text}}
# NEW_SAMPLE TEXT END

Please put your response within <OUTPUT></OUTPUT> tags.
