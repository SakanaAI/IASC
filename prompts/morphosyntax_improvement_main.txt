<!--

This version is modular, allowing us to mix and match different morphosyntactic
areas.  However, we must include word order in any case.

Also some, such as verbal_head_marking.txt and verbal_person_agreement.txt are
mutually exclusive.
-->

We are going to develop a translator for our ConLang, which will translate from
English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but
marks morphosyntactic information such as noun case and verbal tense and aspect
information with abstract morphemes, which we will explain below.  After each
summary explanation, we will indicate which of the described options the
language in question has.

To review from the last time around:

A language also has various options for marking particular morphosyntactic
information, what morphologists term "exponence". Most common are Suffixes, but
languages may also mark information with Prefixes, or by other means such as
changing the form of the base word. In our ConLangs, exponence may be marked
with Suffixes or Prefixes, and this information is specified along with the
morphosyntactic information. If we are specifying that a language marks Ergative
case as a suffix, and verbal Past Tense marking as a prefix, we will indicate
that with a dash before a suffix, or after a prefix:

-ERG
PAST-

Finally we also need to consider word order, which we also describe below.

In most of what follows, we will assume suffixes, and SVO order to keep the
discussion simple.

**MODULES**

Given the above details and specifications for our language, your task is to
'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below along the lines described above.

The last time around for the text below, you produced the annotated version
below, based on the morphosyntactic description given above:

# SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
{{text}}
# SAMPLE TEXT ENDS

# PREVIOUS TRANSLATION BEGINS
{{previous_translation}}
# PREVIOUS TRANSLATION ENDS

Do you see anything in the translation that could be improved to bring it more
in line with the morphosyntactic properties we have described for the language?
PLEASE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THINGS LIKE WHETHER, GIVEN THE SPECIFIED
FEATURES, VERBS ARE APPROPRIATELY MARKED FOR TENSE OR AGREEMENT, NOUNS ARE
APPROPRIATELY MARKED FOR CASE OR NUMBER, AND WHETHER THE WORD ORDER IS CORRECT
GIVEN THE SPECIFICATION. ALSO CHECK THE SPECIFICATIONS OF AFFIXES AND MAKE SURE
THAT IF THE SPECIFICATION SAYS IT'S A PREFIX, THAT YOU HAVE MARKED IT AS A
PREFIX.

IF SO, PLEASE PROVIDE AN COMPLETE IMPROVED TRANSLATION
PUT YOUR TRANSLATION ONLY WITHIN <OUTPUT></OUTPUT> TAGS.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE ORIGINAL FILE. THAT
IS IF THE INPUT FILE HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES,
AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN
THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

This is iteration {{which_iteration}} out of {{num_iterations}} iterations on
this task. If you are getting close to the end and/or if you believe that your
previous translation is doing a reasonable job, please do NOT provide an updated
translation but instead respond as follows:

<OUTPUT>NO CHANGES TO MAKE.</OUTPUT>
