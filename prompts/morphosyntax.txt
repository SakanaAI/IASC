<!-- For the initial version, we will to focus on the following morphosyntactic
categories:

Nominal:	Number, Case
Verbal:		Tense, Aspect, Head Marking

We use WALS to guide the system in choosing which options it wants, but within
each category we provide a hierarchy or set of choices, with canonical names
that the system should use, along with definitions and examples.

We base our case hierarchy on

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_hierarchy

with some modifications.

In this version we skip gender.

We are going to develop a translator for our ConLang, which will translate from
English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but
marks morphosyntactic information such as noun case and verbal tense and aspect
information with abstract morphemes, which we will explain below.  After each
summary explanation, we will indicate which of the described options the
language in question has.

A language also has various options for marking particular morphosyntactic
information, what morphologists term "exponence". Most common are Suffixes, but
languages may also mark information with Prefixes, or by other means such as
changing the form of the base word. In our ConLangs, exponence may be marked
with Suffixes or Prefixes, and this information is specified along with the
morphosyntactic information. If we are specifying that a language marks Ergative
case as a suffix, and verbal Past Tense marking as a prefix, we will indicate
that with a dash before a suffix, or after a prefix:

-ERG
PAST-

Finally we also need to consider word order, which we also describe below.

In most of what follows, we will assume suffixes, and SVO order to keep the
discussion simple.

==============
We will start with nominal (noun) categories, and the first category we will
consider is number marking.  A language may have no number marking, or it may
distinguish:

SING: Singular	(one)
PLUR: Plural    (more than one)
DUAL: Dual      (exactly two)

So in a language with "SING PLUR" marking, one would mark "cat" as "cat-SING"
and "cats" as "cat-PLUR".  If the language has "SING PLUR DUAL" marking, then
"two cats" is "cat-DUAL" and "cat-PLUR" means "three or more cats". If the
language has "NONE", then leave the noun unmarked.

Our language has: "{{number_marking}}".

==============
The next category is case marking.

First you need to decide whether the language is Nominative-Accusative or
Ergative-Absolutive. In a Nominative-Accusative language the subject of a
sentence is marked Nominative and the direct object is Accusative:

John-NOM saw Mary-ACC
John-NOM

In an Ergative-Absolutive language, the subject of a transitive sentence is
marked Ergative, whereas objects of transitive sentences and subjects of
intransitive sentences are marked Absolutive

John-ERG saw Mary-ABS
John-ABS

Beyond these two, there is a more-or-less universal hierarchy of cases with
earlier ones in the following list being more likely than later ones:

GEN:	Genitive. E.g. "John's book" -> "John-GEN book"
DAT:	Dative. E.g. "gave to John" -> "gave John-DAT"
LOC:	Locative: E.g. "in Rome" -> "Rome-LOC"
ABL:	Ablative: E.g. "by Rome"/"with Rome" -> "Rome-ABL"
INS:	Instrumental: E.g. "with glue" -> "glue-INS"

Our language has "{{case_marking}}" case marking.

==============
Next we turn to verbal categories, and the first category is tense and aspect.

On the tense front, languages may distinguish the following:

PRES:    Present tense. E.g. "goes" -> "go-PRES"
PAST:    Past tense. E.g. "went" -> "go-PAST"
FUT:	 Future tense. E.g. "will go" -> "go-FUT"
REMPAST: Remote past. E.g. "went (a long time ago)" -> "go-REMPAST"

A language may also not mark for tense at all.

When it comes to aspect, languages may not mark aspect at all, or they may
distinguish between Perfective and Imperfective aspect:

IMPF: Imperfective.	       E.g. "went" -> "go-IMPF"
PERF: Perfective.	       E.g. "has gone" -> "go-PERF"

A language may have both tense and aspect marking, in which case you should mark
both on the verb. For example,

"will have gone" -> "go-FUT-PERF"
"had gone"       -> "go-PAST-PERF"
"will go"        -> "go-FUT-IMPF

Our language marks "{{tense_aspect}}".

==============
The next verbal category is head marking, i.e. marking information about nominal
arguments of the verb on the verb itself. A language may have no head marking,
or mark various nominal arguments. This can happen even when the language has no
case marking on nouns.

For a Nominative-Accusative language the head might be marked as follows:

VNOM:  Nominative. E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-VNOM"
VACC:  Accusative. E.g. "see the dog" -> "see-VACC dog"
VDAT:  Dative. E.g. "give to the dog " -> "give-VDAT dog"

Note the "V" prefix on the categories to distinguish them from nominal case marking.

A language might mark just Nominative, Nominative and Accusative, or all three.

Similarly for Ergative-Absolutive languages we would find:

VERG:  Ergative. E.g. "John eats something" -> "John eat-VERG"
VABS:  Absolutive. E.g. "see the dog" -> "see-VABS dog";  "John leaves" -> "John leave-VABS"

(We omit dative since that behaves the same as above.)

Alternatively, languages may have more elaborate person agreement on verbs for
arguments such as subjects, objects or indirect objects.  By person, we mean
things like first (1st) person singular for "I", second (2nd) person singular
for "thou", third (3rd) person plural for "they" and so forth.

A language might mark nominative subject agreement on the verb for example:

1SGNOM:	   1st person singular nominative: E.g. "I leave" -> "I leave-1SGNOM"
2SGNOM:	   2nd person singular nominative: E.g. "thou leavest" -> "thou leave-2SGNOM"
3SGNOM:	   3rd person singular nominative: E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-3SGNOM"
1PLNOM:	   1st person plural nominative:   E.g. "we leave" -> "we leave-1PLNOM"
2PLNOM:	   2nd person plural nominative:   E.g. "ye leave" -> "ye leave-2PLNOM"
3PLNOM:	   3rd person plural nominative:   E.g. "John and Mary leave" -> "John and Mary leave-3PLNOM"

Similarly the language might mark accusative objects with person agreement or
indirect objects. Just a couple of examples:

1SGACC:	   1st person singular accusative: E.g. "leave me" -> "leave-1SGACC me"
1SGDAT:	   1st person singular dative:     E.g. "give to me" -> "give-1SGDAT me"

A language might mark just Nominative, Nominative and Accusative, or all three.

In an Ergative-Absolutive language, 1SGERG, for example, would mark the
situation where I am engaging in a transitive action, 1SGABS would obtain if
the action is intransitive, or if I am the direct object of the action:

1SGERG:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I see" -> "I see-1SGERG"
1SGABS:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I run" -> "I run-1SGABS"; "see me" -> "see-1SGABS me"

A language would typically have either the simpler head marking described
previously, or the person-number agreement head marking just described, not
both.

Please note the following important point: you should only head-mark a verb for
an argument if the verb really has the argument in question. Thus

"leave-PRES-VERG-VABS John-ABS"

would be WRONG, because the verb "leave" does not have an Ergative argument in
this case!!!

Our language marks "{{head_marking}}".

Don't forget the prefix/suffix dashes when you add these to words.
==============
We now turn to word order. We will consider the main order of the sentence in
terms of Subject (S), Object (O) and Verb (V). Options are as follows:

VSO: "drink John water"
SVO: "John drink water"
SOV: "John water drink"
VOS: "drink water John"
OVS: "water drink John"
OSV: "water John drink"

Next we consider the order of adjectives and nouns, which may be:

NA: "book red"
AN: "red book"

And adpositions and noun (phrases):

PN: "on table"
NP: "table on"

Our language has

"{{main_word_order}}" main word order.
"{{adj_noun_word_order}}" adjective-noun word order.
"{{adposition_noun_word_order}}" adposition-noun word order.

==============
Given the above details and specifications for our language, your task is to
'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below along the lines described above. To
illustrate again the kind of markup we are looking for, suppose we have a
language with

"-SING -PLUR" number marking
"-ERG -ABS -GEN -DAT" case marking
"PRES- FUT- PAST- PERF-" tense-aspect marking
"VERG- VABS-" head marking on the verb.
"VSO" main word order.
"NA" adjective-noun word order.
"PN" adposition-noun word order.

WE WILL ASSUME IN ADDITION THAT FOR THIS LANGUAGE ADJECTIVES AGREE WITH THE
NOUNS THEY MODIFY IN CASE AND NUMBER.

Then the following sentence:

"The man has given the red book to the octopus in the sea."

could be annotated:

"VERG-VABS-give-PRES-PERF man-SING-ERG book-SING-ABS red-SING-ABS octopus-SING-DAT in sea-SING-ABS."

Similarly

"The man ran into the garden."

would be annotated:

"VABS-run-PAST man-SING-ABS into garden-SING-ABS."

since here the verb is intransitive and the subject should therefore be marked
with ABS case and VABS head marking.

If you feel the language needs other kinds of grammatical markers besides the
ones explicitly given above, please feel free to invent them, but make sure you
follow the format guidelines that have been specified.

Please be sure to give content words in their lemma (dictionary) form. Please
downcase all English words that are not obviously names: i.e. "From" should
become "from", but "John" should be left as "John". DO NOT MARK THE ARTICLES
"the" or "a" BUT RATHER OMIT THESE ENTIRELY. Place a period at the end of each
sentence, as in the English original. Don't forget to translate the title, if
there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper names, which are to be
left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", but "John" would remain "John".

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE SAME LINE STRUCTURE AS THE ORIGINAL FILE. THAT
IS IF THE INPUT FILE HAS 23 LINES YOUR RESULTING OUTPUT SHOULD HAVE 23 LINES,
AND THE TEXT IN LINE k IN YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEXT IN LINE k IN
THE INPUT. DO NOT ADD QUOTES AROUND YOUR OUTPUT.

# SAMPLE TEXT BEGINS
{{text}}
# SAMPLE TEXT END

Please put your response within <OUTPUT></OUTPUT> tags.
