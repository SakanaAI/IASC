<!--

This version is modular, allowing us to mix and match different morphosyntactic
areas.  However, we must include word order in any case.

Also some, such as verbal_head_marking.txt and verbal_person_agreement.txt are
mutually exclusive.

In this case we invert the suffixes and prefixes in the instructions at the end,
just to show that the LLM is getting waylaid by the final instructions and
ignoring what came earlier.

We are going to develop a translator for our ConLang, which will translate from
English sentences into an abstract language that has English content words, but
marks morphosyntactic information such as noun case and verbal tense and aspect
information with abstract morphemes, which we will explain below.  After each
summary explanation, we will indicate which of the described options the
language in question has.

A language also has various options for marking particular morphosyntactic
information, what morphologists term "exponence". Most common are Suffixes, but
languages may also mark information with Prefixes, or by other means such as
changing the form of the base word. In our ConLangs, exponence may be marked
with Suffixes or Prefixes, and this information is specified along with the
morphosyntactic information. If we are specifying that a language marks Ergative
case as a suffix, and verbal Past Tense marking as a prefix, we will indicate
that with a dash before a suffix, or after a prefix:

-ERG
PAST-

Finally we also need to consider word order, which we also describe below.

In most of what follows, we will assume suffixes, and SVO order to keep the
discussion simple.

**MODULES**

Given the above details and specifications for our language, your task is to
'translate' the text under SAMPLE TEXT below along the lines described above. To
illustrate again the kind of markup we are looking for, suppose we have a
language with

"SING- PLUR-" number marking
"ERG- ABS- GEN- DAT-" case marking
"PRES- FUT- PAST- PERF-" tense-aspect marking
"-VERG -VABS" head marking on the verb.
"VSO" main word order.
"NA" adjective-noun word order.
"PN" adposition-noun word order.

WE WILL ASSUME IN ADDITION THAT FOR THIS LANGUAGE ADJECTIVES AGREE WITH THE
NOUNS THEY MODIFY IN CASE AND NUMBER.

Then the following sentence:

"The man has given the red book to the octopus in the sea."

could be annotated:

"PERF-PRES-give-VABS-VERG ERG-SING-man ABS-SING-book ABS-SING-red DAT-SING-octopus in ABS-SING-sea."

Similarly

"The man ran into the garden."

would be annotated:

"PAST-run-VABS ABS-SING-man into ABS-SING-garden."

since here the verb is intransitive and the subject should therefore be marked
with ABS case and VABS head marking.

If you feel the language needs other kinds of grammatical markers besides the
ones explicitly given above, please feel free to invent them, but make sure you
follow the format guidelines that have been specified.

Please be sure to give content words in their lemma (dictionary) form. Do not
mark the articles "the" or "a" but rather omit these entirely. Place a period at
the end of each sentence, as in the English original. Don't forget to translate
the title, if there is one. Downcase all content words, except proper names,
which are to be left capitalized. Thus "Man" would become "man", "We" would
become "we", but "John" would remain "John".
