<INSTRUCTIONS>
We will now develop an orthography for our ConLang. At present we will develop
an orthography using the {{script}} script, which may include extensions with
diacritics, as in the {{script}}-Extended-A and {{script}}-Extended-B Unicode blocks.

The set of phonemes (in IPA) that you developed for this language, is as follows:

Consonants: {{consonants}}
Vowels:     {{vowels}}

A sample of words assuming the above IPA symbols can be found below within the
<LEXICON></LEXICON> block.

<LEXICON>
{{lexicon_sample}}
</LEXICON>

In developing your orthography, feel free to take as examples the spelling
systems of any languages you are familiar with that use the {{script}} script in
their writing system.

Your orthography does not need to be completely "phonetic" in that the
pronunciation is completely reconstructable from the spelling, but it should be
reasonable in that it does not deviate too much from a "shallow orthography".

Once you have developed your spelling system, you should write a Python program
that will convert from the phonetic transcriptions of words into the written
form.

Notice that the input examples above have the phonemes separated by spaces: in
your code you should assume that the phonetic input will have the phonemes
separated in this way. However, the letters in the spelled form should NOT be
space-separated.  If there are symbols in the script that naturally correspond
to more than one phoneme, feel free to include a rule for that, but again be
aware that the phonemes will come in space-separated.

There may also be syllable boundary markers ".". These should be ignored in your
orthography, so please make sure these get deleted and NOT converted into letters.

Your function should be called "ipa_to_orthography", and it should take as input
a word transcribed in IPA, and return a spelling for that word.

Please also provide a main function so that one can feed words in IPA to your
program from the command line: have it read from standard in.

Please make sure you include needed functions and imports in your code.

Place your code in the block <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>.
PLEASE DO NOT PUT ANYTHING EXCEPT VALID PYTHON CODE WITHIN THIS BLOCK.
THIS MUST BE IMPORTABLE AS IS.

This task will depend on your deep knowledge of linguistics, and Python
programming.  Good luck!
