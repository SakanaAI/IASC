<INSTRUCTIONS>
Finally we will write a grammar and reader for our ConLang.

1. NAME

The first thing you need to do is come up with a LANGUAGE_NAME for the ConLang.

2. PHONOLOGY

Then you describe the phonology.

The set of phonemes (in IPA) that you developed for this language, is as follows:

Consonants: {{consonants}}
Vowels:     {{vowels}}

3. ORTHOGRAPHY

Next you will describe the orthography, which is handled by the following code:

# Begin orthography code
{{orthography_code}}
# End orthography code

4. LEXICON

A subset of the lexicon with terms needed for the sample story is as follows:

# Begin lexicon
{{lexicon}}
# End lexicon

5. MORPHOSYNTAX

The morphosyntactic description on which you based your morphosyntax was as
follows. Below I remind you what the different annotations mean, and which
particular annotations were chosen for our language:

NOMINAL MARKING

Number:
SING: Singular	(one)
PLUR: Plural    (more than one)
DUAL: Dual      (exactly two)
Our language has: "{{number_marking}}".

Case:
NOM-ACC or ERG-ABS
GEN:	Genitive. E.g. "John's book" -> "John-GEN book"
DAT:	Dative. E.g. "gave to John" -> "gave John-DAT"
LOC:	Locative: E.g. "in Rome" -> "Rome-LOC"
ABL:	Ablative: E.g. "by Rome"/"with Rome" -> "Rome-ABL"
INS:	Instrumental: E.g. "with glue" -> "glue-INS"
Our language has "{{case_marking}}" case marking.

VERBAL MARKING

Tense-Aspect:
PRES:    Present tense. E.g. "goes" -> "go-PRES"
PAST:    Past tense. E.g. "went" -> "go-PAST"
FUT:	 Future tense. E.g. "will go" -> "go-FUT"
REMPAST: Remote past. E.g. "went (a long time ago)" -> "go-REMPAST"
IMPF: Imperfective.	       E.g. "went" -> "go-IMPF"
PERF: Perfective.	       E.g. "has gone" -> "go-PERF"

Our language marks "{{tense_aspect}}".

Head marking and/or person agreement:
VNOM:  Nominative. E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-VNOM"
VACC:  Accusative. E.g. "see the dog" -> "see-VACC dog"
VERG:  Ergative. E.g. "John eats something" -> "John eat-VERG"
VABS:  Absolutive. E.g. "see the dog" -> "see-VABS dog";  "John leaves" -> "John leave-VABS"
VDAT:  Dative. E.g. "give to the dog " -> "give-VDAT dog"

Or a more detailed person-agreement system such as:

1SGNOM:	   1st person singular nominative: E.g. "I leave" -> "I leave-1SGNOM"
2SGNOM:	   2nd person singular nominative: E.g. "thou leavest" -> "thou leave-2SGNOM"
3SGNOM:	   3rd person singular nominative: E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-3SGNOM"
1SGACC:	   1st person singular accusative: E.g. "leave me" -> "leave-1SGACC me"
1SGDAT:	   1st person singular dative:     E.g. "give to me" -> "give-1SGDAT me"

or

1SGERG:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I see" -> "I see-1SGERG"
1SGABS:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I run" -> "I run-1SGABS"; "see me" -> "see-1SGABS me"

Our language marks "{{head_marking}}".

In addition to the above, you may have invented some further morphosyntactic
markers, which you can discover in the lexicon in all upper-case entries.

INCLUSIVE-EXCLUSIVE DISTINCTION

The inclusive-exclusive distinction applies in particular to the First Person
Plural pronoun "we", and anything that agrees with it (such as a verb).

In English "we" is ambiguous as to whether or not it includes the listener. On
the other hand, many languages distinguish between

1PLINCL	  Inclusive First Person Plural	   "we" including the listener
1PLEXCL	  Exclusive First Person Plural	   "we" excluding the listener

Thus if we translate:

"we like you"

into a language with the INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE distinction, we would translate
"we" here as "1PLEXCL", since it is clear from the meaning that in this case
"we" does not include the listener. On the other hand

"we all agree"

spoken to a group of people, would have "we" translated as "1PLINCL".

Our language has: "{{inclusive_exclusive}}".

GENDER

Many languages have grammatical gender, as distinct from the natural gender
exhibited in English. Well-known examples include Masculine-Feminine gender
systems of Romance languages; the Masculine-Feminine-Neuter system of German or
Russian; or the Common-Neuter system in Dutch or in some Scandinavian
languages. Many languages of Africa have non-sex-based gender systems. Since
sex-based systems are the majority (75% of the sample of gendered languages in
the World Atlas of Language Structures), we will assume a gender-based
system. Options are:

MASC:	Masculine:	E.g. John-MASC, pumpkin-MASC
FEM:	Feminine:	E.g. Sally-FEM, sea-FEM
NEUT:	Neuter:		E.g. snake-NEUT
COMM:	Common gender:	E.g. John-COMM, Sally-COMM

The following gendered systems are possible:

1. MASC, FEM
2. MASC, FEM, NEUT
3. COMMON, NEUT

For personal names, gender appropriate affixes were chosen. For common nouns,
since English does not have gender, you made a decision as to what gender to
assign to the noun, with the injunction: be creative, but be consistent!

Our language marks "{{gender_marking}}".

NUMERAL CLASSIFIERS

Many languages have classifiers that go with numbers, and mark the type of noun
associated with the number.

There are a variety of classifier systems, with some languages like Japanese, or
Chinese, having dozens of classifiers. Classifiers are usually semantically
based, depending on visual or taxonomic features of the noun's meaning.

A typical classifier system might include:

CLFLAT:	  Used with flat objects like paper:		  three CLFLAT paper   "3 pieces of paper"
CLROUND:  Used with round objects like coins:		  twenty CLROUND coin  "20 coins"
CLLONG:	  Used with long objects like string, or rivers:  one CLLONG string "1 piece of string"
CLANIMAL: Used with animals:				  two CLANIMAL cow  "2 cows"

Since the set of possible classifiers is rather open ended, I am simply going to
tell you if our language (a) HAS_CLASSIFIERS or (b) NONE (= no classifiers).
You based your classifier system on what you know about classifiers in languages
that you have read about. The classifier should be introduced between the noun
and the number in your translation.

For our language: "{{numeral_classifier}}".

6. SYNTAX/WORD ORDER

Main:
VSO: "drink John water"
SVO: "John drink water"
SOV: "John water drink"
VOS: "drink water John"
OVS: "water drink John"
OSV: "water John drink"

Adjective-Noun:
NA: "book red"
AN: "red book"

Adposition-Noun:
PN: "on table"
NP: "table on"

Our language has

"{{main_word_order}}" main word order.
"{{adj_noun_word_order}}" adjective-noun word order.
"{{adposition_noun_word_order}}" adposition-noun word order.

7. TEXTS

An example text is as follows, where after "==" the first line is the
morphosyntactic gloss, the second is the phonetic transcription and the final is
the orthographic transcription:

# BEGIN EXAMPLE TEXT
{{sample_text}}
# END EXAMPLE TEXT

==========================

Arrange your handbook according to the format specified between the BEGIN and
END lines below. Try to make your handbook between 500 and 1000 words long:

<!-- TODO(rws): Have this output HTML? Or LaTeX? -->
# BEGIN HANDBOOK TEMPLATE
TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of LANGUAGE_NAME

# Details of the morphosyntax, with some commentary.

SYNTAX

# Details of the syntax/word order, with some commentary.

Place your resulting text in the block <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>.

This task will depend on your deep knowledge of linguistics, and Python
programming.  Good luck!
