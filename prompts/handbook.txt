<INSTRUCTIONS>
Finally we will write a grammar and reader for our ConLang.

1. NAME

The first thing you need to do is come up with a LANGUAGE_NAME for the ConLang.

2. PHONOLOGY

Then you describe the phonology.

The set of phonemes (in IPA) that you developed for this language, is as follows:

Consonants: {{consonants}}
Vowels:     {{vowels}}

3. ORTHOGRAPHY

Next you will describe the orthography, which is handled by the following code:

# Begin orthography code
{{orthography_code}}
# End orthography code

4. LEXICON

A subset of the lexicon with terms needed for the sample story is as follows:

# Begin lexicon
{{lexicon}}
# End lexicon

5. MORPHOSYNTAX

The morphosyntactic description on which you based your morphosyntax was as
follows. Below I remind you what the different annotations mean, and which
particular annotations were chosen for our language. If a specification says
"NONE", then it means that the morphosyntax in the language does not mark
the feature morphologically.

NOMINAL MARKING

Number:
SING: Singular	(one)
PLUR: Plural    (more than one)
DUAL: Dual      (exactly two)
PAUC: Paucal    (a few)
Our language has: "{{nominal_number}}".
Nominal number is marked by "{{nominal_number_marking_strategy}}".

Case:
NOM-ACC or ERG-ABS
GEN:	Genitive. E.g. "John's book" -> "John-GEN book"
DAT:	Dative. E.g. "gave to John" -> "gave John-DAT"
LOC:	Locative: E.g. "in Rome" -> "Rome-LOC"
ABL:	Ablative: E.g. "by Rome"/"with Rome" -> "Rome-ABL"
INS:	Instrumental: E.g. "with glue" -> "glue-INS"
Our language has "{{case_marking}}" case marking.
Case marking is marked by "{{case_marking_strategy}}".
Oblique noun phrases are marked by "{{oblique_case_marking}}".

Definiteness:
DEF:    Definite. E.g. "the cat" -> "DEF cat"
INDEF:  Indefinite. E.g. "a cat" -> "INDEF cat"
Our language has "{{definiteness}}".
In/definiteness is marked by "{{definiteness_marking_strategy}}".
In addition, definiteness marking in our language agrees with "{{definiteness_agreement}}".

ADJECTIVAL MARKING

Adjective agreement:
Agreement on adjective modifiers refers to a grammatical phenomenon where an adjective changes its form to match certain features of the noun it modifies, such as:
- Number (e.g., singular, plural)
- Case (e.g., nominative, accusative, etc.)
- Definiteness
In our language, adjective modifiers show agreement for "{{adjective_agreement}}".
The adjective agreement is marked by "{{adjective_agreement_marking_strategy}}".

Comparative:
COMP:   Comparative degree. E.g. "higher" -> "high-COMP"
SUP:    Superlative degree. E.g. "highest" -> "high-SUP"
EQU:    Equative degree. E.g. "as high (as)" -> "high-EQU (as)"
Our language marks "{{comparative}}".
Comparatives are marked by "{{comparative_marking_strategy}}".

VERBAL MARKING

Tense-Aspect:
PRES:       Present tense. E.g. "goes" -> "go-PRES"
PAST:       Past tense. E.g. "went" -> "go-PAST"
FUT:	    Future tense. E.g. "will go" -> "go-FUT"
IMPERF:     Imperfect tense. E.g. "was going" or "used to go" -> "go-IMPERF"
IMMPAST:    Immediate past. E.g. "went (just now)" -> "go-IMMPAST"
RECPAST:    Recent past. E.g. "went (recently)" -> "go-RECPAST"
REMPAST:    Remote past. E.g. "went (a long time ago)" -> "go-REMPAST"
IMPF:       Imperfective aspect. E.g. "went" -> "go-IMPF"
PERF:       Perfective aspect. E.g. "has gone" -> "go-PERF"
Our language marks "{{tense_aspect}}".
Tense and aspect are marked by "{{tense_aspect_marking_strategy}}".

Person marking:
1SGNOM:	   1st person singular nominative: E.g. "I leave" -> "I leave-1SGNOM"
2SGNOM:	   2nd person singular nominative: E.g. "thou leavest" -> "thou leave-2SGNOM"
3SGNOM:	   3rd person singular nominative: E.g. "John leaves" -> "John leave-3SGNOM"
1SGACC:	   1st person singular accusative: E.g. "leave me" -> "leave-1SGACC me"
1SGDAT:	   1st person singular dative:     E.g. "give to me" -> "give-1SGDAT me"

or

1SGERG:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I see" -> "I see-1SGERG"
1SGABS:	   1st person singular ergative: E.g. "I run" -> "I run-1SGABS"; "see me" -> "see-1SGABS me"

Our language marks "{{person_agreement}}".
Person agreement is marked by "{{person_marking_strategy}}".
Similarly, our language marks verbal number for "{{verbal_number_agreement}}".
Verbal number agreement is marked by "{{verbal_number_marking_strategy}}".

Mood:
IND:    Indicative mood. E.g. "you go to school." -> "you go-IND to school."
IMP:    Imperative mood. E.g. "Go to school!" -> "go-IMP to school!"
SUB:    Subjunctive mood. E.g. "(I hope that) you go to school." -> "you go-SUB to school."
COND:   Conditional mood. E.g. "(If you had a chance,) you would go to school." -> " "you go-COND to school."
Our language marks "{{mood}}".
Grammatical mood is marked by "{{mood_marking_strategy}}".

Voice:
ACT:    Active voice. e.g. "John chases Mike."
PASS:   Passive voice. e.g. "John is chased by Mike."
Our language marks "{{voice}}".
Grammatical voice is marked by "{{voice_marking_strategy}}".

Infinitive:
INF:    Infinitive.
Our language marks "{{infinitive}}".
Infinitive is marked by "{{infinitive_marking_strategy}}".

Negation:
Our language marks negation (NEG) by "{{negation}}".

Relativization:
Our language marks relativization (REL) by (1) "{{relativization_order}}" with a (2) "{{relativization_marking}}" (3) "{{relativizer_position}}" (4) "{{relativizer_morpheme}}".
For example, let's say we have a relativized phrase "The book that I read was fascinating".
- In a language that introduces a relative clause in (1) head-initial order with a (2) head-marking (3) postpositional (4) word, we would have: "book REL I read was fascinating".
- In a language that introduces a relative clause in (1) head-final order with a (2) dependent-marking (3) postpositional (4) affix, we would have: "I read-REL book was fascinating."

In addition to the above, you may have invented some further morphosyntactic
markers, which you can discover in the lexicon in all upper-case entries.

INCLUSIVE-EXCLUSIVE DISTINCTION

The inclusive-exclusive distinction applies in particular to the First Person
Plural pronoun "we", and anything that agrees with it (such as a verb).

In English "we" is ambiguous as to whether or not it includes the listener. On
the other hand, many languages distinguish between

1PLINCL	  Inclusive First Person Plural	   "we" including the listener
1PLEXCL	  Exclusive First Person Plural	   "we" excluding the listener

Thus if we translate:

"we like you"

into a language with the INCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE distinction, we would translate
"we" here as "1PLEXCL", since it is clear from the meaning that in this case
"we" does not include the listener. On the other hand

"we all agree"

spoken to a group of people, would have "we" translated as "1PLINCL".

Our language has: "{{inclusive_exclusive}}".

6. SYNTAX/WORD ORDER

Main:
VSO: "drink John water"
SVO: "John drink water"
SOV: "John water drink"
VOS: "drink water John"
OVS: "water drink John"
OSV: "water John drink"

NA: "book red"
AN: "red book"

"{{adposition_noun_word_order}}" adposition-noun word order.
"{{posspron_noun_word_order}}" possessive pronoun-noun word order.
"{{num_noun_word_order}} numeral-noun word order.

7. TEXTS

An example text is as follows, where after "==" the first line is the
morphosyntactic gloss, the second is the phonetic transcription and the final is
the orthographic transcription:

# BEGIN EXAMPLE TEXT
{{sample_text}}
# END EXAMPLE TEXT

==========================

Arrange your handbook according to the format specified between the BEGIN and
END lines below. Try to make your handbook between 500 and 1000 words long:

<!-- TODO(rws): Have this output HTML? Or LaTeX? -->
# BEGIN HANDBOOK TEMPLATE

Place your resulting text in the block <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>.

This task will depend on your deep knowledge of linguistics, and Python
programming.  Good luck!
