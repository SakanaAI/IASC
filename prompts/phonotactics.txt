<INSTRUCTIONS>
The first phase in creating any ConLang is to create a set of words for the
language. Typically this involves defining the phoneme set, including some
information about their relative frequency as well as their phoneme classes
(consonant, vowel, tone) and phonetic features.

Then one needs to define a set of morpheme templates, which define possible
morpheme shapes. This could be as simple as "CVC" for a language that allows CVC
syllables, to something more complex like "CCVC.CCVC" for languages that allow
disyllabic morphemes with each syllable of the form "CCVC".

We are going to create a language that has a phoneme set and morpheme shapes
that are similar to those of {{language}}. In this first phase, I want you to
design a set of phonemes similar to those of {{language}}, with similar relative
frequencies for the phonemes to those of that language. All phonemes should be
represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

Then you will design a set of morpheme templates similar to the patterns found
in {{language}}.

Your design should be implemented as a standalone Python program that takes as a
command-line argument the number of morpheme forms to generate. For example:

python3 your_program.py --num_morphemes 100

would randomly generate 100 morphemes. Within each morpheme, please place spaces
between every phoneme, i.e.

"o k a tʃ a"

rather than

"okatʃa"

Your code should include two global dictionaries, one named "consonants" and the
other named "vowels". These should contain the phonemes mapped to their relative
frequencies. Thus for example, a partial consonant dictionary might include:

consonants = {"m": 3, "n": 7 ...}

Please make sure you include needed functions and imports in your code.

Finally, place your resulting code in the block <OUTPUT></OUTPUT>.
PLEASE DO NOT PUT ANYTHING EXCEPT THE PYTHON CODE WITHIN THIS BLOCK.

This task will depend on your deep knowledge of linguistics, and Python
programming.  Good luck!
