TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Thrlangai

PHONOLOGY

Thrlangai has a rich phonological inventory consisting of 26 consonants and 15 vowels. The consonant system includes plosives, nasals, fricatives, affricates, and approximants, with some less common sounds such as the voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ and the voiceless trill /r̥/. The vowel system is equally diverse, featuring both monophthongs and diphthongs.

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥
Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The language allows for complex consonant clusters, as seen in words like 'skchïd' (old) and 'thrshýl' (grocery).

ORTHOGRAPHY

Thrlangai uses a modified Latin alphabet to represent its sounds. Most consonants are represented by their IPA equivalents, with some exceptions:

- /ŋ/ is written as 'ng'
- /θ/ is written as 'th'
- /ʃ/ is written as 'sh'
- /χ/ is written as 'kh'
- /ð/ is written as 'dh'
- /tʃ/ is written as 'ch'
- /dʒ/ is written as 'j'
- /ɬ/ and /ɬ̥/ are both written as 'lh'
- /r̥/ is written as 'rh'

Vowels use diacritics to distinguish between similar sounds:

- /e/ is written as 'é'
- /ɪ/ is written as 'ï'
- /o/ is written as 'ó'
- /ʊ/ is written as 'ü'
- /ə/ is written as 'ë'
- /ɨ/ is written as 'ý'

The diphthongs /aɪ/, /aʊ/, and /ɔɪ/ are written as 'ai', 'au', and 'oi' respectively.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Thrlangai exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, with postpositional words marking case. The language uses the following cases: ergative (ERG), absolutive (ABS), genitive (GEN), and instrumental (INS).

Verbs in Thrlangai do not mark tense or aspect. However, they do show agreement with both the ergative and absolutive arguments, distinguishing between singular and plural for first, second, and third person.

The language employs several additional morphosyntactic markers, including:

- NEG: Negation marker
- REL: Relative clause marker
- COMP: Comparative marker
- EQU: Equative marker
- SUP: Superlative marker

Thrlangai does not mark grammatical gender or have an inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns.

The language employs a classifier system, though the specific classifiers are not detailed in the provided information.

SYNTAX

Thrlangai follows an Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order for main clauses. This is a relatively rare word order among the world's languages.

Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and adpositions follow their noun complements (NP order). These characteristics align with the language's general head-final tendency, as seen in the OSV word order.
