TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zhevronian

PHONOLOGY

Zhevronian has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded and unrounded front vowels. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, giving Zhevronian a distinctive sound profile.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zhevronian uses a modified Arabic script for its orthography. Each phoneme is represented by a unique Arabic character or a modified version thereof. For example:

- /p/ is represented by پ
- /ʃ/ is represented by ش
- /ɲ/ is represented by ڽ
- /y/ is represented by ۆ

The orthography is largely phonemic, with each sound having a consistent written representation. This makes reading and writing Zhevronian relatively straightforward once the script is learned.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Zhevronian exhibits a rich morphological system with both inflectional and derivational processes. Some key features include:

1. Case system: Zhevronian has seven cases - nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, ablative, locative, and instrumental. These are marked by suffixes on nouns.

2. Number: The language distinguishes between singular and plural, marked by suffixes (-ke for singular, -ʃɑ̃ for plural).

3. Tense and aspect: Verbs are marked for present, past, and future tenses, as well as various aspects like perfective and imperfective.

4. Person and number agreement: Verbs agree with their subjects in person and number.

5. Voice: Active and passive voices are distinguished morphologically.

6. Mood: Indicative and conditional moods are marked on verbs.

7. Negation: Negation is expressed through a verbal suffix.

8. Derivational morphology: Zhevronian has various affixes for deriving new words, such as the superlative prefix 'səl-'.

SYNTAX

Zhevronian follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN order).
2. Postpositions are used instead of prepositions (NP order).
3. Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -lœn on the verb of the relative clause.
4. Subordinate clauses generally precede the main clause.
5. Question words typically appear in situ (in the same position as the corresponding non-question words would appear in a declarative sentence).
