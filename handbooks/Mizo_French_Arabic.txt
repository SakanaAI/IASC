TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Shalāni

PHONOLOGY

Shalāni has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded and unrounded front vowels. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, which are relatively uncommon cross-linguistically.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Shalāni uses a modified Arabic script for its orthography. Vowels are represented by both full letters and diacritical marks. Some notable features include:

- The use of پ (p), گ (g), and ڤ (v) for sounds not typically found in Arabic
- Representation of /ɲ/ with ڽ
- Use of ۆ for /ɥ/
- Diacritical marks for vowels, e.g., ِ (i), ُ (u), َ (a)
- Special combinations for nasal vowels, e.g., اٰ (ɑ̃), وٰ (ɔ̃)

The orthography is written right-to-left, following Arabic convention.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Shalāni exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, marked by postpositional words. The main cases are:

- Ergative (ٍ)
- Absolutive (غٍت)
- Genitive (not shown in examples)
- Instrumental (وُ)

The language lacks grammatical gender and does not mark tense on verbs. However, it has a complex system of person agreement markers for both ergative and absolutive arguments:

Ergative: 1SGERG-, 2SGERG-, 3SGERG-, 1PLERG-, 2PLERG-, 3PLERG-
Absolutive: -1SGABS, -2SGABS, -3SGABS, -1PLABS, -2PLABS, -3PLABS

Shalāni uses numeral classifiers, although examples are not provided in the given text.

Other notable morphological features include:

- Comparative marker (نيِغ)
- Superlative marker (ٜ)
- Equative marker (اَ)
- Relative clause marker (-َ)
- Negation suffix (-غٰا)

SYNTAX

Shalāni follows an Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. Other syntactic features include:

- Noun-Adjective order (NA)
- Noun-Postposition order (NP)

Relative clauses are marked with the suffix -َ on the verb.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various features of Shalāni:

1. ٍشيِس نيِغ ٍسيِت اَسٍس ٍ اَسوُغ غٍت َسيِتلگ َلاَف غٍت ٍسَک اَڽَن ٜسيِف نيِلغت
si.ʃe ʁin ti.se se.sa e ʁu.sa teʁ gltis-ɛ fa.lɛ teʁ kɛ.se nɛ.ɲa fi.sɔ tʁlin .
smart COMP student we ERG school ABS in-REL he ABS is with first singular .
"We are smarter students than he who is in school."

This example demonstrates the comparative construction, ergative-absolutive case marking, and the relative clause structure.

2. اَژوُگ ٜ سٛژغد ساَکلپ ٍ غٍت تٍيلگ َٜڽاَد تيِتغگ غٍت ٍسَک اَڽَن کاَسکس نيِلغت

hot SUP day year ERG ABS so far-REL today ABS is with third singular .
"Today is the hottest day of the year so far."

This sentence shows the superlative construction and the use of the relative clause marker.

3. َٰشٰازٍ اَغَک نيِغ اَتٚن ٍ َلٍنلب تٚملپ غٍت ٍسَک اَڽَن کاَسکس نيِلغت
ez.ɑ̃ʃɛ̃ kɛ.ʁa ʁin nə.ta e blnel-ɛ plmət teʁ kɛ.se nɛ.ɲa sksak tʁlin .
delicious cake COMP i ERG tasted-REL this ABS is with third singular .
"This is the most delicious cake I have tasted."

This example illustrates the OSV word order, ergative marking on the first-person pronoun, and the use of the comparative marker in a superlative context.
