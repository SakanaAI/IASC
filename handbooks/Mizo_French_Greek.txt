TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Neogrekos

PHONOLOGY

Neogrekos has a rich phonological inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels like /y/ and /ø/. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, which are less common cross-linguistically.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Neogrekos uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

- The use of 'ου' for /u/
- 'ζ̌' represents /ʒ/
- 'ν̃' represents the palatal nasal /ɲ/
- Nasal vowels are marked with a tilde: 'α̃', 'ο̃', 'ε̃'

The orthography aims to maintain a close correspondence with the phonology while utilizing familiar Greek letters.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Neogrekos exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, marked by postpositional words. The main cases are:

- Ergative (ε)
- Absolutive (τερ)
- Genitive (not specified in the sample)
- Instrumental (ου)

Verbs show agreement with both ergative and absolutive arguments, distinguishing singular and plural for all three persons. For example:

- 1SGERG: First person singular ergative
- 3PLABS: Third person plural absolutive

The language lacks grammatical gender and does not mark tense or aspect on verbs. However, it employs various particles for comparison (ριν for comparative, α for equative, ο for superlative) and negation (-α̃ρ).

Neogrekos uses numeral classifiers, although specific examples were not provided in the sample text.

SYNTAX

The basic word order in Neogrekos is Object-Subject-Verb (OSV), which is relatively rare among the world's languages. Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and the language uses postpositions rather than prepositions (NP order).

Example of OSV order:
σεςε φλλεμ γλφοσ ε πλσενα̃ρ
food its cat ERG eat-NEG
"The cat doesn't eat its food."
