TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Nerusan

PHONOLOGY

Nerusan has a phoneme inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features a mix of common and less common sounds. Notable features include:
- A dental fricative /θ/
- Palatal nasal /ɲ/ and lateral /ʎ/
- Both a tap /ɾ/ and trill /r/
- Palatal approximant /j/ and fricative /ʝ/

The vowel system is a standard five-vowel system common in many languages.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Nerusan uses a Cyrillic-inspired script. Some key correspondences:

- /θ/ is written as ѳ
- /ɲ/ as њ
- /ʎ/ as љ
- /r/ (trill) as р̃
- /ʝ/ as ј

Most other sounds use their closest Cyrillic equivalent. This orthography allows Nerusan to have a distinct visual identity while maintaining some familiarity for readers of Cyrillic-using languages.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Nerusan exhibits an ergative-absolutive alignment in its verbal morphology. Verbs agree with both the ergative and absolutive arguments through suffixes.

Tense is marked through suffixes with four distinctions:
- Nonpast (-са)
- Immediate past (-ро)
- Recent past (-са)
- Remote past (-си)

Number is marked on nouns with singular (-но) and plural (-ри) suffixes.

The language features an inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person plural pronouns:
- 1PLINCL: си (inclusive "we")
- 1PLEXCL: нер (exclusive "we")

Other notable morphological features include:
- Comparative (ре) and superlative (на) markers
- A relative clause marker (-лес)
- A negation suffix (-ран)

Nerusan uses numeral classifiers, though the specific classifiers are not detailed in the provided information.

"The wind blows strongly today"

Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN order):
