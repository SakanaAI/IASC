TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Shalāmi

PHONOLOGY

Shalāmi has a rich phonemic inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels (y, œ, ø). The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, which are relatively uncommon cross-linguistically.

Shalāmi allows for complex syllable structures, with consonant clusters permitted in both onset and coda positions. Stress is not phonemic and typically falls on the final syllable of a word.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Shalāmi uses an Arabic-inspired script, with each phoneme represented by a unique character. The orthography is largely phonemic, with a close correspondence between sounds and symbols. Some notable features include:

- Vowel length is not distinguished in writing.
- Nasal vowels are marked with a superscript alif (ٰ).
- The script is written from right to left.

Examples:
/pøʁe/ (in) -> پۆرە
/tɛ̃ʁa/ (garden) -> تعٰرا
/ʁɛ̃sɔ̃/ (grocery) -> رٱسۅٰ

MORPHOSYNTAX

Shalāmi exhibits a mix of agglutinative and fusional morphology. Key features include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: Singular (-et) and plural (-u) suffixes
   - No case marking

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense-aspect: Suffixes for nonpast (-ɥat), immediate past (-ɛn), recent past (-em), and remote past (-ka)
   - Person agreement: Ergative-absolutive alignment with suffixes for person and number

3. Other features:
   - Inclusive-exclusive distinction in first person plural pronouns
   - No grammatical gender
   - Numeral classifiers

Derivational morphology includes suffixes for comparatives (-kas) and superlatives (-e).

SYNTAX

Shalāmi has a relatively rare Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) word order for main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

- Adjective-Noun order: Adjectives precede the nouns they modify
- Adposition-Noun order: Prepositions are used rather than postpositions
- Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -ɛ on the verb

The language uses postverbal negation with the suffix -œs.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various features of Shalāmi:

1. وادي سعسٱ کاس نيزەەت پۆرە بلفٱر گردٱرەت درتان سەرۆۆاتەع سەرۆۆاتە
   wa.di sɛ.sə kas ni.ze-et pø.ʁe blfəʁ gʁdəʁ-et dʁtan se.ʁy-ɥat-e-ɛ se.ʁy-ɥat-e .
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG .
   "The smartest student in our school is he."

This example demonstrates the OVS word order, the use of the comparative suffix -kas, and the relative clause marker -ɛ.

2. کلنيم وادي گلپەنو پۆرە تعدە وادي گرژعٰمو سپتۅسۆاترٱم
   klnim wa.di glpen-u pø.ʁe tɛ.de wa.di gʁʒɛ̃m-u sptɔs-ɥat-ʁəm .
   from the tree-PLUR in autumn the leaf-PLUR fall-NPAST-3PL .
   "From the trees in autumn, the leaves fall."

This sentence shows the use of plural marking (-u) and the nonpast tense with third person plural agreement (-ɥat-ʁəm).

3. وودي لعپو ساتا کاڽيۏس سننۆکۆاتيەک
   wo.di lɛ.po sa.ta ka.ɲi-œs snnøk-ɥat-jek .
   very well i swim-NEG can-NPAST-1SG .
   "Very well I cannot swim."

This example illustrates the use of negation (-œs) and first person singular agreement in the nonpast tense (-ɥat-jek).
