TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zuhkari

PHONOLOGY

Zuhkari has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for both open and closed syllables, with a preference for CV structure. Consonant clusters are permitted but generally limited to two consonants. Stress typically falls on the penultimate syllable.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zuhkari uses a modified Arabic script for its writing system. Consonants are represented by Arabic letters, while vowels are indicated by diacritical marks above or below the consonants. Some notable features include:

- The use of پ (pe) for /p/, چ (che) for /tʃ/, and غ (ghain) for /g/
- Short vowels are represented by diacritics: َ (fatha) for /a/, ُ (damma) for /o/, ِ (kasra) for /i/, ٜ for /e/, and ٗ for /u/
- Word-initial vowels are carried by alif (ا)

This orthography allows for a compact writing system that reflects the phonological structure of the language.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Zuhkari exhibits a mix of agglutinative and fusional morphology. Key features include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: Singular (-a) and plural (-son) suffixes
   - No case marking on nouns

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense-aspect: Non-past (-re), immediate past (-ni), recent past (-u), remote past (-o) suffixes
   - Person agreement: Ergative-absolutive alignment with suffixes (e.g., -ho for 1SG, -ron for 3SG)
   - Negation: Suffix -go

3. Inclusive-exclusive distinction in first person plural pronouns:
   - 1PLINCL: a
   - 1PLEXCL: son

4. Other notable morphemes:
   - Relative clause marker: -i
   - Comparative: em
   - Superlative: e
   - Plural: -son

SYNTAX

Zuhkari follows an OVS (Object-Verb-Subject) word order for main clauses, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN)
2. Adposition-Noun order: Prepositions are used (PN)
3. Relative clauses: Marked with the suffix -i on the verb and typically follow the noun they modify
4. Question formation: Primarily through intonation, with question words remaining in situ
5. Coordination: Conjunctions like "kusa" (and) join clauses or phrases

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various aspects of Zuhkari grammar:

1. ُغٜز ٜكَز ٜم ٗوَكاَ ٜچٜت ٜتٜه ُكٜناَ ٜتاَُي ٗكُهٜرُرِن ٗكُهٜرُرن
   go.ze ke.za me wu.ka-a tʃe.te te.he ko.ne-a teajo ku.ho-re-ron-i ku.ho-re-ron
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "The smartest student in our school is he."

2. ٜهٜن ُغٜز ٗسُتُسن ٜچٜت ِسُن ُغٜز َكُمُسن ٗسٗهٜرَت
   he.ne go.ze su.to-son tʃe.te si.no go.ze ka.mo-son su.hu-re-ta
   from the tree-PLUR in autumn the leaf-PLUR fall-NPAST-3PL
   "From the trees in autumn, the leaves fall."

3. ِتَت ُيٗن ٜسَتٜو ِچَمِداَ ٗوٜغ ِكُس ُدٗكاَ ُسن ُغِداٗاَ ُنٜر ٜغَك
   ti.ta jo.nu se.tawe tʃi.ma.di-a wu.ge ki.so do.ku-a son go.di-u-a no.re ge.ka
   with a different contractor-SING for this project-SING 1PLEXCL decide-RECPAST-1PL to go
   "With a different contractor for this project, we (excl.) decided to go."

These examples demonstrate the OVS word order, use of case markers, tense-aspect suffixes, and the inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns.
