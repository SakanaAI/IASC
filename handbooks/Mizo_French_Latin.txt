TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Sénalang

PHONOLOGY

Sénalang has a rich phonological inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels (y, ø, œ) which are relatively uncommon cross-linguistically. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative ʁ and the palatal nasal ɲ, adding to the language's distinctive sound.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Sénalang uses a Latin-based alphabet with some diacritics to represent its sounds. Notable features include:

- 'c' represents /k/
- 'ch' represents /ʃ/
- 'j' represents /ʒ/
- 'ń' represents /ɲ/
- 'r' represents /ʁ/
- 'y' represents /j/
- 'ü' represents /ɥ/
- 'ou' represents /u/
- 'oe' represents /œ/
- 'eu' represents /ø/
- Nasal vowels are marked with a cedilla: ą (/ɑ̃/), ǫ (/ɔ̃/), ę (/ɛ̃/)

The orthography aims to be phonemic, with each letter or digraph corresponding to a single phoneme in most cases.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Sénalang exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, marked by postpositional words. The main cases are:

- Ergative (ERG): marked by 'é'
- Absolutive (ABS): marked by 'tér'
- Instrumental (INS): marked by 'ou'

The language lacks grammatical gender and does not mark tense on verbs. However, it has a complex system of verbal agreement, marking both ergative and absolutive arguments on the verb for person and number.

Other notable morphosyntactic features include:

- Comparative (COMP): marked by 'rin'
- Superlative (SUP): marked by 'ò'
- Equative (EQU): marked by 'a'
- Relative clause marker (REL): suffix '-è'
- Negation (NEG): suffix '-ąr'

Sénalang also employs numeral classifiers, although the specific classifiers are not detailed in the provided information.

SYNTAX

Sénalang has an unusual Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order for main clauses. This is a rare word order, found in only about 0.3% of the world's languages.

Other syntactic features include:

- Noun-Adjective (NA) order
- Noun-Postposition (NP) order

These word orders contribute to the language's head-final tendencies, which is consistent with its OSV main clause order.
