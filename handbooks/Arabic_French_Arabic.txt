TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Dömkala

PHONOLOGY

Dömkala has a rich phonemic inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language distinguishes between voiced and voiceless consonants, and includes several nasal vowels. The presence of both /y/ and /u/ is notable, as is the inclusion of the uvular fricative /ʁ/. The vowel system is quite symmetrical, with front rounded vowels balancing their unrounded counterparts.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Dömkala uses a modified Arabic script for its writing system. Each phoneme is represented by a single character, with some creative adaptations to represent sounds not typically found in Arabic. For example:

- /p/ is represented by پ
- /v/ is represented by ڤ
- /ɲ/ is represented by ڽ
- /y/ is represented by ۆ
- /ø/ is represented by ۊ

Nasal vowels are indicated by the addition of a small alif above the vowel character, e.g., اٰ for /ɑ̃/.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Dömkala exhibits a rich morphological system with both prefixes and suffixes. Nouns are marked for number (singular, plural, dual) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive). Verbs are marked for tense (present, past, future), aspect, and person/number agreement.

Notable features include:

1. Three-way number distinction: singular (-lۇ), plural (-na), and dual (-ە)
2. Case marking: nominative (-as), accusative (-pe), genitive (-شٱغ)
3. Definite (-tan) and indefinite (-سيغ) markers
4. Verbal person/number agreement (e.g., -غۇن for 3SG, -ۇ for 3PL)
5. Tense markers: present (-نيغ), past (-ۇغ), future (-ە)
6. Comparative (-ۆ) and superlative (-ۆن) suffixes
7. Passive voice marker (-ەغ)

The language also uses prefixes, such as دۉم- for definiteness.

SYNTAX

Dömkala follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and prepositions precede their objects (PN order).

Example of basic word order:
تەڤەەغۇنۇ ۆت دۉمفغتٱللۇاس شيۋالۇ ڤغسەکلۇپەتان
te.ve-e-ʁɔn-ɔ ot dœm-fʁtəl-lɔ-as ʃi.ɥa-lɔ vʁsɛk-lɔ-pe-tan
eat-FUT-3SG-ACT NEG DEF-cat-SING-NOM food-SING its-SING-ACC-DEF
"The cat will not eat its food."

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle ۆم (ym) and follow the noun they modify.
