TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Neokoine

PHONOLOGY

Neokoine has a rich phonemic inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels (y, œ, ø) which are typologically less common. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, giving the language a somewhat French-like quality.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Neokoine uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

- Use of digraphs for some sounds: ου /u/, αι /ɛ/
- Repurposing of obsolete Greek letters: ϸ /ʃ/, ϻ /ʒ/, ϙ /œ/
- Use of diacritics for nasal vowels: ᾶ /ɑ̃/, ῶ /ɔ̃/, ᾶι /ɛ̃/
- The letter υ represents /y/ when alone, but /ɥ/ after vowels

Some orthographic rules apply, such as σ becoming ζ before voiced consonants, and simplification of double σ to single σ.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Neokoine exhibits a rich morphological system with both prefixes and suffixes. Key features include:

1. Nominal morphology:
   - Number: singular (-λω), plural (-να), dual (-αι)
   - Case: nominative (-ασ), accusative (-πε), genitive (-ϸϵρ)
   - Definiteness: definite (δϙμ-), indefinite (-σιρ)

2. Verbal morphology:
   - Tense: present (-νιρ), past (-ωρ), future (-ε)
   - Aspect: perfective (-ω), imperfective (-ερ)
   - Person agreement: 1sg (-ταιλ), 2sg (-ι), 3sg (-ρων), 1pl (-ω), 3pl (-οϋ)
   - Voice: active (-ω), passive (-ερ)

3. Adjective morphology:
   - Degree: comparative (-υ), superlative (-ον)

4. Other features:
   - Subordination marker (-ιν)
   - Locative case (-τεκ)

SYNTAX

Neokoine follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order for main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Noun-Adjective (NA) order: The adjective follows the noun it modifies.
2. Preposition-Noun (PN) order: Prepositions precede their object nouns.
3. Relative clauses are introduced by the particle υμ and follow the noun they modify.
4. Negation is expressed by the particle οτ placed before the verb.
