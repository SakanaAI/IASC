TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Thalassian

PHONOLOGY

Thalassian has a rich phonemic inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥
Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

Notable features include:
- A three-way distinction between voiced, voiceless, and aspirated consonants
- Both dental and alveolar fricatives
- A voiceless lateral fricative (ɬ) and its aspirated counterpart (ɬ̥)
- A rich vowel system with both monophthongs and diphthongs

The language allows complex syllable structures, including consonant clusters.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Thalassian uses a modified Greek alphabet for its writing system. Some key correspondences include:

- ς represents /ʃ/ (except word-finally where it represents /s/)
- χ represents /χ/
- γγ represents /ŋ/
- ου represents /u/
- αι, αυ, οι represent the diphthongs /aɪ/, /aʊ/, /ɔɪ/ respectively

Special combinations:
- τς represents /tʃ/
- τζ represents /dʒ/
- λλ represents /ɬ/
- λχ represents /ɬ̥/
- ρχ represents /r̥/

The orthography includes some context-sensitive rules, such as using ς for word-final /s/.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Thalassian is a highly agglutinative language with a rich system of affixes. Key features include:

1. Nominal morphology:
   - Number: singular (-φεκ), plural (-ωελ), dual (-νιτ)
   - Case: nominative (-ηλ), accusative (-κε), genitive (-βοτζ)
   - Definiteness: definite (ηρχ-), indefinite (-δηβ)

2. Verbal morphology:
   - Tense: present (-ογγ), past (-λου), future (-εκ)
   - Aspect: perfective (-θε), imperfective (unmarked)
   - Voice: active (-θε), passive (-ςαυλλ)
   - Person agreement: 1sg (-ςωω), 2sg (-ιιβ), 3sg (-ος), 1pl (-ςι), 3pl (-θε)

3. Adjectives:
   - Comparative: -ωουκ
   - Superlative: -αω

4. Other features:
   - Locative case: -θο
   - Subordinate marker: -ιλ

SYNTAX

Thalassian follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: NA (Noun-Adjective)
2. Adposition-Noun order: PN (Preposition-Noun)
3. Relative clauses are introduced by the particle νω and follow the noun they modify
4. Negation is expressed by the particle κω placed before the verb
5. Questions are formed by intonation rather than word order change
