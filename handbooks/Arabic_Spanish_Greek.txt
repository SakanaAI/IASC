TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Ετνανο (Etnano)

PHONOLOGY

Ετνανο has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features a contrast between voiced and voiceless stops, as well as a rich set of fricatives and liquids. The presence of palatal consonants (ɲ, ʎ, ʝ) adds complexity to the system.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Ετνανο uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Most letters correspond directly to their IPA equivalents, with a few exceptions:

- 'ου' represents /u/
- 'τσ' represents /tʃ/
- 'νι' represents /ɲ/
- 'λι' represents /ʎ/
- 'ρρ' represents /r/ (as opposed to 'ρ' for /ɾ/)
- 'γι' represents /ʝ/

The orthography is largely phonemic, making it relatively easy to read and write once the system is learned.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Ετνανο exhibits a rich morphological system with both nominal and verbal inflection.

Nouns are marked for number (singular, plural) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive). Cases are marked by suffixes:
- Nominative: -ρο
- Accusative: -ρας
- Genitive: -νες

Verbs are marked for tense (present, past, future), aspect, and person/number agreement. The language uses a nominative-accusative alignment system. Verb suffixes include:
- Present: -νο
- Past: -σαλ
- Future: -λε

Person agreement is marked by suffixes such as:
- 1SG: -ριν
- 3SG: -λε
- 3PL: -διν

The language also has a range of other grammatical markers, including:
- Definite article: νου-
- Comparative: -ρας
- Superlative: -λερ
- Passive: -λιν

Ετνανο does not mark grammatical gender and does not have an inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns.

SYNTAX

Ετνανο follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and the language uses prepositions (PN order).

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle 'ραρ' and follow the noun they modify.
