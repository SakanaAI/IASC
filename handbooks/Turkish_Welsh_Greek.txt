TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Kythosian

PHONOLOGY

Kythosian has a rich phonemic inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥
Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

Notable features include:
- A three-way distinction in plosives (voiced, voiceless, aspirated)
- Both voiced and voiceless lateral fricatives (ɬ, ɬ̥)
- A voiceless rhotic (r̥)
- A rich vowel system including diphthongs

The language allows complex syllable structures, with consonant clusters permitted in both onset and coda positions.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Kythosian uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some notable correspondences include:

- ŋ is represented by γγ
- ʃ is represented by ς
- tʃ is represented by τς
- dʒ is represented by τζ
- ɬ is represented by λλ
- h is represented by ͱ
- ɬ̥ is represented by λ̥λ
- r̥ is represented by ρ̥
- u is represented by ου
- ɨ is represented by υ

Diphthongs are represented by combinations of vowel letters: αι for aɪ, αυ for aʊ, οι for ɔɪ.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Kythosian is a highly agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes marking various grammatical categories:

Nouns:
- Number: Singular (-νυ) and Plural (-ρεπ)
- Case: Nominative (-αυρ̥), Accusative (-γγεκ), Dative (-ηω), Genitive (-δυ), Ablative (-ουν), Locative (-ͱι), Instrumental (-ρηγγ)

Verbs:
- Tense: Present (-ατ), Past (-ρι), Future (-κον)
- Mood: Indicative (-ουγ), Conditional (-μυθ)
- Voice: Active (-τζατς), Passive (-μω)
- Person/Number agreement: 1SG (-τζερ), 2SG (-αιμ), 3SG (-λαλ), 1PL (-ωφ), 3PL (-ολ)

Other notable suffixes:
- Negation: -και
- Relative clause marker: -ωη

Kythosian also uses prefixes for comparison:
- Comparative: ριτς-
- Superlative: αιν-

SYNTAX

Kythosian follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

- Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN order)
- Adpositions follow their noun phrases (NP order)
- Relative clauses are marked on the verb with the suffix -ωη and typically follow the noun they modify
- Subordinate clauses generally precede the main clause
- Questions are formed by intonation rather than word order change
