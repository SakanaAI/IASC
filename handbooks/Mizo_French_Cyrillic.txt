TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Cyrillic Ergative (Сирилик Ергатив)

PHONOLOGY

Cyrillic Ergative has a rich phonological inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded and unrounded front vowels. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the labio-palatal approximant /ɥ/, which are relatively uncommon cross-linguistically.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Cyrillic Ergative uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet. Some notable features include:

- The use of ъ for /ə/
- ў for /w/
- њ for /ɲ/
- ѧ, ѫ, ѩ for nasal vowels /ɑ̃/, /ɔ̃/, /ɛ̃/ respectively
- ѳ for both /ɔ/ and /ø/

This orthography allows for a unique visual representation of the language while maintaining a connection to Cyrillic traditions.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Cyrillic Ergative, as its name suggests, employs an ergative-absolutive case system. The language marks case using postpositional words:

- Ergative: е
- Absolutive: тер
- Instrumental: у

The language does not mark number on nouns, but it does have a complex verbal agreement system that marks both ergative and absolutive arguments on the verb. For example:

- 1SGERG: (not shown in examples)
- 3SGABS: тер

Other notable morphosyntactic features include:

- Comparative: рин
- Superlative: ѳ
- Equative: а
- Relative clause marker: -э

Negation is marked with the suffix -ѧр.

SYNTAX

Cyrillic Ergative has an unusual Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order, which is rare among the world's languages. This is consistently applied in the example sentences.

Other syntactic features include:

- Noun-Adjective order (NA): "book red" instead of "red book"
- Noun-Postposition order (NP): "table on" instead of "on table"

These features combine to give Cyrillic Ergative a distinct syntactic profile that sets it apart from many other languages.
