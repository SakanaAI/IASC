TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Shosholang

PHONOLOGY

Shosholang has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels.

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for both open and closed syllables, with a preference for CV structure. Consonant clusters are relatively rare, occurring mainly in loanwords or at morpheme boundaries.

ORTHOGRAPHY

The orthography of Shosholang is largely phonemic, with a few digraphs for sounds not represented by single letters in the Latin alphabet:

- 'sh' represents /ʃ/
- 'ch' represents /tʃ/
- 'y' represents /j/

Most other sounds are represented by their IPA equivalents. One notable orthographic rule is that a double 'o' at the end of a word is written as 'oo' rather than 'o'.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Shosholang exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, marked by postpositional words. The main case markers are:

- 'ra' for ergative
- 'u' for absolutive
- 'ban' for instrumental

The language does not mark grammatical gender or have an inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns. It also lacks overt tense marking on verbs.

Verbs agree with both the ergative and absolutive arguments in person and number. For example:

- '-seta coza sanso' marks 1st person singular ergative
- '-seta husha sanso' marks 3rd person singular ergative
- '-seta coza cuci' marks 1st person plural ergative

Shosholang uses classifiers with numbers, although the specific classifiers are not detailed in the provided information.

SYNTAX

Shosholang has an unusual Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order for its main clauses. This is relatively rare among the world's languages.

Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and adpositions follow their noun phrases (NP order). These postpositional phrases often function as case markers.
