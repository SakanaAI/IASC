TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Kethosian

PHONOLOGY

Kethosian has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows consonant clusters and diphthongs. Syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), with some more complex structures permitted.

Notable features:
- Presence of both /s/ and /ʃ/ (sh)
- Inclusion of the affricate /tʃ/ (ch)
- Lack of voiced fricatives other than /z/
- Use of both approximants /j/ and /w/

ORTHOGRAPHY

Kethosian uses a modified Greek alphabet for its writing system. Some key correspondences:

- ʃ is represented by ϸ
- tʃ is written as τϸ
- j is written as ι
- w is written as ω

The orthography is largely phonemic, with a close correspondence between sounds and symbols. This makes reading and writing Kethosian relatively straightforward once the system is learned.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Kethosian exhibits a rich morphological system with both nominal and verbal inflection.

Nouns are marked for:
- Number (singular -tu, plural -tu)
- Case (nominative -zo, accusative -a, dative -u, genitive -pu, ablative -u, locative -go, instrumental -u)

Verbs are marked for:
- Tense (present -o, past -i, future -a)
- Aspect (perfective -se)
- Mood (indicative -o, conditional -ton)
- Person and number agreement (e.g. 1sg -a, 3sg -ten, 3pl -a)
- Voice (active -se, passive -a)

Other notable morphological features:
- Comparative marker: san
- Superlative marker: u
- Negation marker: -u

SYNTAX

Kethosian follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

- Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN order)
- Postpositions are used instead of prepositions (NP order)
- Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -mo on the verb
