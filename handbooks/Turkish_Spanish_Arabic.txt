TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Alnari

PHONOLOGY

Alnari has a phoneme inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features a contrast between dental and palatal laterals (l vs. ʎ) and between a tap and trill (ɾ vs. r). It also has both a palatal approximant and fricative (j vs. ʝ).

The syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), allowing for consonant clusters in onset and coda positions.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Alnari uses an Arabic-inspired script, with each phoneme represented by a unique character. Some notable correspondences include:

- θ is written as ث
- x is written as خ
- tʃ is written as چ
- ɲ is written as ڽ
- ʎ is written as ڵ
- ɾ is written as ر
- r is written as ڕ
- ʝ is written as ژ

Vowels are represented as follows:
a: ا, e: ە, i: ی, o: ۆ, u: و

The script is written from right to left, following Arabic convention.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Alnari is an agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes for grammatical functions.

Nouns are marked for number (singular -sa, plural -sa), case (nominative -ren, accusative -ne, dative -na, genitive -se, ablative -rur, locative -le, instrumental -sa), and definiteness (definite -aʎsu).

Verbs are marked for tense (present -so, past -la, future -len), aspect (imperfective -sa), mood (indicative -sa, conditional -si), person/number agreement (1SG -lu, 2SG -nod, 3SG -sal, 1PL -ner, 3PL -di), and voice (active -ral, passive -na).

Other notable morphemes include:
- Comparative: si
- Superlative: do
- Negation: -su
- Relative clause marker: -nen

SYNTAX

Alnari follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify, while adpositions follow their noun complements (postpositions).

Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -nen on the verb and precede the noun they modify.

The language uses postpositions rather than prepositions, consistent with its SOV structure.
