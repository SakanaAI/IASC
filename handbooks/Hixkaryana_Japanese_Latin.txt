TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zohulang

PHONOLOGY

Zohulang has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for both open and closed syllables, with a preference for CV structure. Consonant clusters are limited, primarily occurring across syllable boundaries.

Notable features:
- The presence of both /s/ and /ʃ/ (represented as 'sh' in orthography)
- The affricate /tʃ/ (represented as 'ch' in orthography)
- The approximants /j/ and /w/ (represented as 'y' and 'w' respectively)

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zohulang uses a modified Latin alphabet. Most sounds correspond directly to their IPA equivalents, with a few exceptions:

- /k/ is written as 'c'
- /ʃ/ is written as 'sh'
- /tʃ/ is written as 'ch'
- /j/ is written as 'y'

There is one special orthographic rule for vowel combinations:
- The sequence 'ou' represents /o u/

Example: /ko.zu/ is written as "cozu"

MORPHOSYNTAX

Zohulang exhibits an agglutinative morphology with a rich system of suffixes. Key features include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: Singular (-a) and Plural (-son)
   - No case marking

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense-aspect: Non-past (-re), Immediate past (-ni), Recent past (-u), Remote past (-o)
   - Person agreement: Ergative-Absolutive alignment
     1SG: -ho, 2SG: -sun, 3SG: -ron, 1PL: -a, 3PL: -ta
   - Other verbal suffixes: Negative (-go), Relative clause marker (-i)

3. Inclusive-Exclusive distinction in first person plural:
   - 1PLINCL: a
   - 1PLEXCL: son

4. No grammatical gender

5. Numeral classifiers are used, though specific examples are not provided in the lexicon

Other notable morphemes:
- Comparative: me
- Equative: a
- Superlative: e

SYNTAX

Zohulang has an OVS (Object-Verb-Subject) main word order, which is typologically rare. Other word order features include:

- Adjective-Noun (AN): Adjectives precede the nouns they modify
- Preposition-Noun (PN): Prepositions come before their object nouns

The language uses postpositions for subordinate clauses, as evidenced by the relative clause marker -i appearing at the end of the verb.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are two example sentences from the provided text:

1. Goze ceza me wucaa chete tehe conea teayo cuhoreroni cuhoreron.
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "The smart student in our school is he."

2. Tinda hosa goze cazua cemureron.
   strongly today the wind-SING blow-NPAST-3SG
   "The wind blows strongly today."

3. Nore yonu shoce negaa son ragirea, tace pacu were giziraa cagoreron.
   to a new office-SING 1PLEXCL move-NPAST-1PL, but here your department-SING stay-NPAST-3SG
   "We are moving to a new office, but your department is staying here."

These examples demonstrate the OVS word order, the use of suffixes for tense and person agreement, and the placement of adjectives before nouns.
