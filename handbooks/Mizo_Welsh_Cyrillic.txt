TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Krylovik

PHONOLOGY

Krylovik has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several uncommon consonants, including the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative /ɬ/ and its devoiced counterpart /ɬ̥/, as well as a devoiced trill /r̥/. The presence of both dental and alveolar fricatives (/θ, ð/ and /s, z/) adds to the phonemic richness.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system includes both tense and lax vowels, a central vowel /ə/, and three diphthongs. The high central vowel /ɨ/ is a relatively uncommon phoneme that adds to the language's distinctive sound.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Krylovik uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

1. Use of 'ң' for the velar nasal /ŋ/
2. 'ѳ' represents the voiceless dental fricative /θ/
3. 'ђ' is used for the voiced dental fricative /ð/
4. 'ԓ' represents the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative /ɬ/
5. Diacritics are used to distinguish certain vowels: 'ӥ' for /ɪ/, 'ӧ' for /ɔ/, 'ӯ' for /ʊ/, 'ӕ' for /æ/

The orthography aims to maintain a close correspondence between phonemes and graphemes, with a few digraphs for complex sounds like /tʃ/ (ч) and /dʒ/ (џ).

MORPHOSYNTAX

Krylovik exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, marked by postpositional words. The main cases are:

1. Ergative (ERG): нӕб
2. Absolutive (ABS): му
3. Genitive (GEN): (not shown in the sample, but mentioned as present)
4. Instrumental (INS): һә

The language lacks number marking on nouns but has a rich system of verbal agreement markers for person and number in both ergative and absolutive alignments. For example:

- 1SGERG: (not shown in the sample, but part of the system)
- 3SGABS: (not explicitly shown, but implied in verb forms)

Other notable morphosyntactic features include:

- Comparative marker (COMP): мән
- Equative marker (EQU): гэг
- Superlative marker (SUP): ӥк
- Negation suffix: -ек
- Relativizer suffix: -но

The language uses classifiers with numbers, though no examples were provided in the sample text.

SYNTAX

Krylovik has an Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order for main clauses. This is a relatively rare word order cross-linguistically, found in only about 0.3% of the world's languages.

Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and adpositions are postpositions (NP order). For example:

- ѳркус мән хэсә (smart COMP student) "smarter student"
- флдән-но (in-REL) "in which"

The language uses postpositional words for case marking, which appear after the noun phrase they modify.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, with orthographic transcription, gloss, and English translation:

1. Ўэсу гўрӥт скчӥд крԓомно гэсе ђӯфи ѳргихи гэг гэсе лӧнэ му рәђу снпӧр грнайм лаўбэн.
   new phone old model-REL as twice expensive EQU as the ABS is with third singular
   "The new phone is twice as expensive as the old model."

2. Һӧфффи снлӯб мән кӥвӧ нӕб йӥђино йане му рәђу снпӧр грнайм лаўбэн.
   delicious cake COMP i ERG tasted-REL this ABS is with third singular
   "This is the most delicious cake I have tasted."

3. Крдэр му флдән бәмо му кўдың снпӧр грнайм стсик.
   wind ABS in leaves ABS rustled with third plural
   "The leaves rustled in the wind."

These examples showcase the OSV word order, postpositional case marking, and the use of various morphosyntactic features like the comparative marker and relativizer.
