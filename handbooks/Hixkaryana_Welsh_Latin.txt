TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Lhwénai

PHONOLOGY

Lhwénai has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several uncommon consonants, including the voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ and its devoiced counterpart /ɬ̥/, as well as the voiceless alveolar trill /r̥/. These sounds add a unique character to the language's phonetic profile.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system includes both monophthongs and diphthongs, with a distinction between tense and lax vowels (e.g., /i/ vs /ɪ/, /u/ vs /ʊ/). The central vowel /ɨ/ adds to the language's phonetic complexity.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Lhwénai uses a Latin-based alphabet with some diacritics and digraphs to represent its phonemes. Notable features include:

- 'ng' for /ŋ/
- 'th' for /θ/, 'dh' for /ð/
- 'sh' for /ʃ/, 'kh' for /χ/
- 'ch' for /tʃ/, 'j' for /dʒ/
- 'lh' for both /ɬ/ and /ɬ̥/
- 'rh' for /r̥/

Vowels use diacritics to distinguish between similar sounds:
- 'é' for /e/, 'ó' for /o/
- 'ï' for /ɪ/, 'ü' for /ʊ/
- 'ë' for /ə/, 'ý' for /ɨ/
- 'æ' for /æ/

Diphthongs are written as combinations of vowels: 'ai', 'au', 'oi'.

   - Inclusive/Exclusive distinction in first person plural pronouns: 
     'ne' (1PLINCL) vs 'sén' (1PLEXCL)

SYNTAX

Lhwénai has an Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) word order for main clauses. This is a rare word order among the world's languages, adding to the uniqueness of Lhwénai.

Other syntactic features include:
- Adjective-Noun (AN) order
- Preposition-Noun (PN) order

These word order characteristics create an interesting mix of head-initial (PN) and head-final (AN, OV) structures.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various features of Lhwénai:

1. Smthéf lhwpæh ük brnushsých hénga shutu furusých frthen lhwlëkshórkées lhwlëkshórké.
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

This sentence demonstrates the comparative construction (ük), singular marking (-sých), and the relative clause structure (-es).

2. Sïmu smthéf wüsheye hénga taudü smthéf nübüye drbülhshórïk.
   from the tree-PLUR in autumn the leaf-PLUR fall-NPAST-3PL
   "The leaves fall from the trees in autumn."

This example shows plural marking (-ye) and the non-past tense with third-person plural agreement (-shórïk).
