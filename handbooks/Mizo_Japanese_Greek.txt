TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Hellenikos

PHONOLOGY

Hellenikos has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for some consonant clusters, particularly in syllable-initial position. The phonotactics generally follow a (C)(C)V(C) structure, with some restrictions on which consonants can appear together.

Notable features include:
- The presence of both the palato-alveolar fricative /ʃ/ and affricate /tʃ/
- The inclusion of approximants /j/ and /w/
- A balanced five-vowel system common in many world languages

ORTHOGRAPHY

Hellenikos uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some key correspondences include:

- /ʃ/ is represented by ς
- /tʃ/ is represented by τς
- /u/ is represented by ου
- /j/ is represented by ι
- /w/ is represented by ω

The orthography is largely phonemic, with a few digraphs and special rules:
- Double sigma (σσ) is simplified to a single σ
- Word-initial /ʃ/ is written as σ instead of ς

This system allows for a clear representation of the language's phonology while maintaining a connection to its Greek-inspired aesthetic.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Hellenikos exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. The case marking is done through postpositional words, rather than affixes. The main cases are:

- Ergative (ERG): ρα
- Absolutive (ABS): ου
- Genitive (GEN): (not specified in the given information)
- Instrumental (INS): βαν

The language does not mark grammatical number on nouns, lacking a singular-plural distinction.

Verbs in Hellenikos do not mark tense or aspect. However, they do show agreement with both the ergative and absolutive arguments using prefixes. For example:

- 1SGERG: (not specified)
- 3SGABS: (not specified)

Additional grammatical categories include:

- Comparative (COMP): χεν
- Equative (EQU): του
- Superlative (SUP): γο
- Relative clause marker (REL): -α
- Negation (NEG): -ι

Hellenikos also employs a system of numeral classifiers, though the specific classifiers are not provided in the given information.

SYNTAX

Hellenikos has a typologically unusual Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order for its main clauses. This order is quite rare among the world's languages.

Other word order features include:
- Noun-Adjective (NA) order
- Noun-Postposition (NP) order

These features combine to create a consistently head-final structure in noun phrases and adpositional phrases, contrasting with the object-initial structure of main clauses.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showing the orthography, gloss, and English translation:

1. Χοκε χεν ναβι σιτα ρα ρουγου ου ςοςοα χαμα ου χαδα σετα κοζα σανσο .
   smart COMP student we ERG school ABS in-REL he ABS is with first singular .
   "We are smarter than the student who is in school."

2. Κιτι γο νασε παρο ρα ου νεκο σοποα χοτε ου χαδα σετα χουσα σανσο .
   hot SUP day year ERG ABS so far-REL today ABS is with third singular .
   "Today is the hottest day of the year so far."

3. Ωιδου σεχε βουκα ου ςοςο γουσα σετα χουσα κουκι .
   flowers many garden ABS in bloom with third plural .
   "Many flowers are blooming in the garden."

These examples demonstrate the OSV word order, postpositional case marking, and verb-final structure of Hellenikos.
