TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Nerosian

PHONOLOGY

Nerosian has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language includes some less common sounds like the palatal nasal ɲ, the palatal lateral approximant ʎ, and the voiced palatal fricative ʝ. It distinguishes between a tap ɾ and a trill r.

Syllable structure appears to be (C)V(C), allowing both open and closed syllables.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Nerosian uses a Latin-based alphabet with some modifications:

- ɲ is written as ñ
- ʎ is written as ll
- ɾ is written as r
- r (trill) is written as rr
- j is written as y
- ʝ is written as j
- x is written as ch
- θ is written as th
- tʃ is written as tch

Other sounds are written as in the IPA. This orthography allows for a relatively close correspondence between pronunciation and spelling.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Nerosian exhibits an ergative-absolutive alignment in its verbal morphology. Verbs agree with both the ergative and absolutive arguments through suffixes.

Tense is marked on verbs with the following suffixes:
- -sa: Non-past/Recent past
- -ro: Immediate past
- -si: Remote past

Person agreement suffixes:
- -do: 1SG
- -li: 2SG
- -so: 3SG
- -ra: 1PL
- -nos: 3PL

Other verbal suffixes include:
- -ran: Negative
- -les: Relative clause marker

Nouns are marked for number:
- -no: Singular
- -ri: Plural

Nerosian distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns:
- ner: 1PL exclusive
- si: 1PL inclusive

The language uses comparative and superlative particles:
- re: Comparative
- ro: Equative
- na: Superlative

Nerosian employs numeral classifiers, though the specific classifiers are not provided in the given information.

SYNTAX

Nerosian has an OVS (Object-Verb-Subject) main word order, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. It uses prepositions (PN order) and places adjectives before nouns (AN order).

Example of OVS order:
sodi etrano salasaso
the movie-SING start-NPAST-3SG
"The movie starts."
