TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Kethébik

PHONOLOGY

Kethébik has a rich phonological inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several uncommon consonants, including the voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ and its devoiced counterpart /ɬ̥/, as well as the voiceless uvular fricative /χ/. The presence of both /r/ and /r̥/ (voiceless alveolar trill) is also noteworthy.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system is quite extensive, including both monophthongs and diphthongs. The presence of both tense and lax vowels (e.g., /i/ vs /ɪ/, /u/ vs /ʊ/) allows for fine distinctions in vowel quality.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Kethébik uses a modified Latin alphabet. Most consonants are represented straightforwardly, with a few exceptions:

- /ŋ/ is written as 'ng'
- /θ/ is written as 'th'
- /ʃ/ is written as 'sh'
- /χ/ is written as 'kh'
- /ð/ is written as 'dh'
- /tʃ/ is written as 'ch'
- /dʒ/ is written as 'j'
- /ɬ/ and /ɬ̥/ are both written as 'lh'
- /r̥/ is written as 'rh'

Vowels use diacritics to distinguish between similar sounds:

- /e/ is written as 'é'
- /o/ is written as 'ó'
- /ɪ/ is written as 'ï'
- /ʊ/ is written as 'ü'
- /ə/ is written as 'ë'
- /ɨ/ is written as 'y'

The diphthongs /aɪ/, /aʊ/, and /ɔɪ/ are written as 'ai', 'au', and 'oi' respectively. The vowel /æ/ retains its IPA symbol in the orthography.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Kethébik is a highly agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes. Nouns are marked for number (singular -nü, plural -rëp) and case. The case system includes:

- Nominative: -aurh
- Accusative: -ngek
- Dative: -éw
- Genitive: -dhü
- Ablative: -un

Verbs are marked for tense (present -at, past -rï, future -kon), mood (indicative -ug, conditional -müth), person, and number. They also distinguish between active (-jach) and passive (-mó) voice. Negation is marked by the suffix -kai.

Other notable morphological features include:
- Comparative: rich
- Superlative: ain
- Relative clause marker: -wé

SYNTAX

Kethébik follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN), while adpositions follow their noun phrases (NP).

Example of basic word order:
Krchiraurh linunüngek rütærïuglaljach.
I-NOM book-ACC write-PAST-IND-3SG-ACT
"I wrote the book."

Modifiers typically come before the noun:
Sklash linunüaurh dudheaurh gécheatuglaljach.
new book-NOM the-NOM be-PRES-IND-3SG-ACT
"The new book exists."

Postpositions are used instead of prepositions:
Shusinühi rhibé
school-LOC in
"in the school"
