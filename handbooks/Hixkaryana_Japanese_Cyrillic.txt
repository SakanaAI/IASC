TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Kuhoran

PHONOLOGY

Kuhoran has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for both open and closed syllables, with a preference for CV structure. Consonant clusters are permitted but generally limited to two consonants. The phonotactics favor alternating consonants and vowels, giving the language a rhythmic quality.

Notable features include:
- The presence of both the palatal approximant /j/ and the labiovelar approximant /w/
- A distinction between /s/ and /ʃ/, as well as /t/ and /tʃ/
- No phonemic vowel length distinction

ORTHOGRAPHY

Kuhoran uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Each phoneme corresponds to a single Cyrillic letter:

k -> к, s -> с, t -> т, n -> н, h -> х, m -> м, r -> р, g -> г, z -> з, d -> д, 
b -> б, p -> п, ʃ -> ш, tʃ -> ч, j -> й, w -> ў
a -> а, o -> о, u -> у, e -> е, i -> и

This orthography provides a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols, making the writing system highly phonemic and easy to learn.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Kuhoran exhibits an ergative-absolutive alignment in its verbal morphology. The language marks tense-aspect through suffixes on the verb, with four distinctions: nonpast (-ре), immediate past (-ни), recent past (-у), and remote past (-о).

Person and number are marked on the verb through suffixes:
- First person singular: -хо
- Second person singular: -сун
- Third person singular: -рон
- First person plural: -а
- Third person plural: -та

The language distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns: 'а' for inclusive and 'сон' for exclusive.

Nouns are marked for number with -а for singular and -сон for plural. There is no grammatical gender or case marking on nouns.

Additional morphological features include:
- Negation suffix: -го
- Relative clause marker: -и
- Comparative marker: ме
- Superlative marker: е

Kuhoran uses numeral classifiers, which are placed between the noun and the number.

SYNTAX

Kuhoran follows an Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) word order for main clauses. This relatively rare word order gives the language a distinct character. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN), and prepositions are used before noun phrases (PN).

Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -и on the verb of the relative clause. The relative clause typically follows the noun it modifies.

Questions are formed by intonation rather than word order change, with question words remaining in situ.
