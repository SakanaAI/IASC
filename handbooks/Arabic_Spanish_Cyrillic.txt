TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Etnaril

PHONOLOGY

Etnaril has a phoneme inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features several palatal consonants (ɲ, ʎ, ʝ) and distinguishes between a tap (ɾ) and trill (r). The consonant inventory includes both dental (θ) and velar (x) fricatives, which is relatively uncommon cross-linguistically.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Etnaril uses a Cyrillic-based orthography. Some notable correspondences include:

θ -> ѳ
ɲ -> њ
ʎ -> љ
r -> р̃ (r with tilde)
ʝ -> ј

The orthography is largely phonemic, with most sounds having a one-to-one correspondence with letters. This makes reading and writing Etnaril relatively straightforward once the system is learned.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Etnaril exhibits a rich morphological system with both nominal and verbal inflection.

Nouns are marked for number (singular, plural, dual) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive). Case is indicated through suffixes:
- Nominative: -ро
- Accusative: -рас
- Genitive: -нес

Verbs are marked for tense (present, past, future), aspect, and person agreement. Tense markers include:
- Present: -но
- Past: -сал
- Future: -ле

Person agreement is complex, with distinct markers for subject and object agreement. For example:
- 1st person singular subject: -рин
- 3rd person plural subject: -дин

The language also employs various derivational affixes, such as:
- Superlative: -лер
- Comparative: -рас
- Passive: -лин

Etnaril uses classifiers with numbers, though the specific classifier system is not detailed in the provided information.

SYNTAX

Etnaril follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order, which is relatively uncommon among the world's languages. Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and prepositions precede their noun phrases (PN order).

Relative clauses are introduced with the particle рар and follow the noun they modify.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are two example sentences from the provided text:

1. Етнаноле нуатлосес рар соросесрона ринудрассесрона серо нири нуарлесес рар наласесрона.

2. Насесалдинна нулолираро алле нуносесеснес.

Gloss: play-PAST-3PL-ACT DEF-child-PLUR-NOM in DEF-park-SING-GEN

These examples demonstrate the VSO word order, the use of case markers, and the placement of relative clauses.
