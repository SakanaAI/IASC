TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Sérulang

PHONOLOGY

Sérulang has a rich phonological inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels (y, ø, œ) which are typologically less common. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the labio-palatal approximant /ɥ/, adding to the language's distinctive sound.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Sérulang uses a Latin-based alphabet with some digraphs and diacritics:

Consonants:
p, b, t, d, c (for /k/), g, f, v, s, z, ch (for /ʃ/), j (for /ʒ/), 
m, n, gn (for /ɲ/), l, r (for /ʁ/), y (for /j/), ü (for /ɥ/), w

Vowels:
i, u (for /y/), ou (for /u/), é, e (for /ə/), o, è (for /ɛ/), 
eu (for both /œ/ and /ø/), a, an (for /ɑ̃/), on (for /ɔ̃/), in (for /ɛ̃/)

This orthography allows for a relatively close correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, with some exceptions like the dual use of "eu" for both /œ/ and /ø/.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Sérulang exhibits a rich morphological system, particularly in its verbal inflections:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: Singular (-ét) and Plural (-ou) suffixes
   - No case marking

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense-aspect: Nonpast (-üat), Immediate past (-èn), Recent past (-ém), Remote past (-ca)
   - Person agreement: Ergative-Absolutive alignment
     Ergative suffixes: -yéc (1SG), -o (2SG), -é (3SG), -bén (1PL), -rem (3PL)
     Absolutive suffixes are not explicitly shown in the examples

3. Other morphemes:
   - Negation: -eus
   - Relative clause marker: -è

4. Inclusive-Exclusive distinction:
   1PLINCL: cheu
   1PLEXCL: rim

5. No grammatical gender

6. Numeral classifiers are used, but not shown in the provided examples

SYNTAX

Sérulang has the following word order characteristics:

1. Main clause order: OVS (Object-Verb-Subject)
2. Adjective-Noun order: AN (Adjective precedes Noun)
3. Adposition-Noun order: PN (Preposition precedes Noun)

This combination of word orders is typologically rare, making Sérulang quite distinctive in its syntax.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, with orthographic transcription, gloss, and English translation:

1. Wadi sèse cas nizéét peuré blfer grderét drtan séruüatéè séruüaté.
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "The smartest student in our school is he."

2. Clnim wadi glpénou peuré tèdé wadi grjinmou sptosüatrem.
   from the tree-PLUR in autumn the leaf-PLUR fall-NPAST-3PL
   "From the trees in autumn, the leaves fall."

3. Trral prgnal tayiét prgnal scderét drtan tivoémé.
   to his cousin-SING his bicycle-SING he lend-RECPAST-3SG

These examples demonstrate the OVS word order, the use of tense-aspect suffixes, and the placement of prepositions before nouns.
