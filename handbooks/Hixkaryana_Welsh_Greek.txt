TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zethalian

PHONOLOGY

Zethalian has a rich phonological inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several unusual consonants, including the voiceless lateral fricative ɬ and its devoiced counterpart ɬ̥, as well as a devoiced trill r̥. The presence of both θ and ð is relatively uncommon cross-linguistically.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system is quite extensive, including both tense and lax vowels (e.g., i/ɪ, u/ʊ) and three diphthongs. The presence of ɨ adds to the richness of the vowel space.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zethalian uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

1. Use of digraphs for certain sounds: 'ου' for /u/, 'αι' for /aɪ/, 'αυ' for /aʊ/, 'οι' for /ɔɪ/.
2. Diacritics to represent some consonants: 'σ̱' for /ʃ/, 'λ̥' for /ɬ/, 'ρ̥' for /r̥/.
3. Repurposing of Greek letters: 'β' represents /b/ instead of /v/.
4. Use of 'γγ' for /ŋ/, similar to some Greek dialects.

The orthography system allows for a unique visual representation of the language while maintaining some familiarity for those acquainted with the Greek alphabet.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Zethalian exhibits a rich morphological system with several notable features:

1. Number: Singular (-συτσ) and plural (-ιε) are marked on nouns.
2. Tense-Aspect: Four tenses are marked on verbs through suffixes:
   - Non-past (-σ̱ωρ)
   - Immediate past (-τατ)
   - Recent past (-δεω)
   - Remote past (-φυτζ)

3. Person Agreement: The language uses an ergative-absolutive alignment with person markers for both the ergative and absolutive cases. For example:
   - 1SG ergative: -ιλ̥
   - 3PL absolutive: -ικ

4. Negation: Verbs can be negated using the suffix -δηδ.

5. Comparative and Superlative: Marked by 'υκ' (comparative) and 'νην' (superlative).

6. Inclusive-Exclusive Distinction: The language distinguishes between inclusive (νε) and exclusive (σην) first person plural pronouns.

7. Classifiers: Zethalian uses classifiers, although the specific system is not detailed in the provided information.

SYNTAX

Zethalian follows an Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) word order, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. This order is exemplified in sentences like:

σμθεφ φρπανσυτσ σετα κρνιγγ σκποπδεωκη
the.mouse until it run-RECPAST-3SG
"Until the mouse ran"

Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun (AN) order: Adjectives precede the nouns they modify.
2. Preposition-Noun (PN) order: Prepositions come before their object nouns.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various features of Zethalian:

1. Ζμθηφ λ̥ωπαχ υκ βρνουσ̱συτσ χηγγα σ̱ουτου φουρουσυτσ φρθεν λ̥ωλεκσ̱ωρκηεσ λ̥ωλεκσ̱ωρκη.
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

This sentence demonstrates the comparative construction, singular marking, and the relative clause structure.

2. Σιμου ζμθηφ ωυσ̱ειε χηγγα ταυδυ ζμθηφ νυβυιε δρβυλ̥σ̱ωρικ.
   from the tree-PLUR in autumn the leaf-PLUR fall-NPAST-3PL
   "The leaves fall from the trees in autumn."

This example shows plural marking, the use of prepositions, and verb agreement with a plural subject.

3. Χηγγα ζμθηφ νηπισυτσ ζμθηφ τσασαυιε βουιωδεωικ.
   in the park-SING the child-PLUR play-RECPAST-3PL
   "The children played in the park."

This sentence illustrates the contrast between singular and plural marking, as well as the recent past tense.
