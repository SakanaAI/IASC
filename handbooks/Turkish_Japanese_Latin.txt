TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Shunari

PHONOLOGY

Shunari has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows consonant clusters and diphthongs. Syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), with most words following a CVCV pattern.

Notable features:
- The presence of both /ʃ/ and /tʃ/ affricates
- Lack of /l/, with /r/ serving as the only liquid consonant
- A balanced five-vowel system common in many world languages

ORTHOGRAPHY

Shunari uses a modified Latin alphabet. Most sounds correspond directly to their IPA equivalents, with a few exceptions:

- /ʃ/ is written as 'sh'
- /tʃ/ is written as 'ch'
- /j/ is written as 'y'

Long vowels are marked with a circumflex:
- /ii/ becomes 'î'
- /uu/ becomes 'û'

Example: The word /muuji/ "minute" is written as "mûyi"

MORPHOSYNTAX

Shunari is an agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes for both nouns and verbs.

Nominal morphology:
- Number: singular (-tu) and plural (-tu)
- Case: nominative (-zo), accusative (-a), dative (-u), genitive (-pu), ablative (-u), locative (-go), instrumental (-u)

Verbal morphology:
- Tense: present (-o), past (-i), future (-a)
- Aspect: perfective (-se)
- Mood: indicative (-o), conditional (-ton)
- Person agreement: 1sg (-a), 2sg (-i), 3sg (-ten), 1pl (-ten), 3pl (-a)
- Voice: active (-se), passive (-a)

Other notable morphemes:
- Negation: -u
- Relativizer: -mo

Shunari does not mark gender grammatically and lacks an inclusive/exclusive distinction in pronouns.

SYNTAX

Shunari follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order. Other syntactic features include:

- Adjectives precede nouns (AN)
- Postpositions follow nouns (NP)
- Relative clauses precede the noun they modify
- Subordinate clauses generally come before the main clause

The language uses postpositions rather than prepositions, consistent with its head-final nature.
