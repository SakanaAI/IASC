TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Neolekta

PHONOLOGY

Neolekta has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features a contrast between voiced and voiceless consonants, as well as a three-way distinction in place of articulation for stops and fricatives (labial, coronal, and velar/uvular). The vowel system is particularly complex, with front rounded vowels and nasal vowels that are typical of languages like French.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Neolekta uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

- The use of 'ου' to represent /u/
- Diacritics to represent nasal vowels (e.g., 'α̃' for /ɑ̃/)
- The use of 'ϸ' and 'ϸ́' for /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ respectively
- 'ϵ' represents /œ/ and /ø/

This orthography allows for a unique visual representation while maintaining some connection to the Greek alphabet.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Neolekta exhibits a rich morphological system with both fusional and agglutinative features:

1. Nouns are marked for number (singular -κε, plural -ϸα̃) and case (nominative -κε̃σ, accusative -εμ, dative -ϸερ, genitive -ο, ablative -ο, locative -α, instrumental -ε).

2. Verbs are marked for tense (present -ι, past -νο̃λ, future -κε), mood (indicative -ουλ, conditional -δατ), person and number (e.g., 1SG -μα, 3PL -ελ), and voice (active -ουτ, passive -ε).

3. The language uses suffixes for various grammatical functions, such as negation (-ε), relativization (-λϵν), and comparison (comparative ϵ, superlative σελ).

4. Neolekta employs a complex system of verbal agreement, marking both subject and object on the verb.

SYNTAX

Neolekta follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order, which is relatively uncommon among the world's languages. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: Adjectives precede the nouns they modify.
2. Postpositions: Adpositions follow their noun phrases, contrary to the more common prepositional structure.
3. Relative clauses: Based on the examples, it appears that relative clauses follow their head nouns and are marked with the suffix -λϵν on the verb.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various features of Neolekta:
