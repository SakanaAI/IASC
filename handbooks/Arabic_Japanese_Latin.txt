TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zashuni

PHONOLOGY

Zashuni has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows consonant clusters and diphthongs. Syllable structure is typically (C)V(C), with most words being disyllabic or trisyllabic.

Notable features:
- The presence of both /s/ and /ʃ/ (sh) allows for contrastive sibilants
- The affricate /tʃ/ (ch) adds complexity to the consonant inventory
- The five-vowel system is symmetrical and common cross-linguistically

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zashuni uses a modified Latin alphabet. Most sounds correspond directly to their IPA equivalents, with a few exceptions:

- /ʃ/ is written as 'sh'
- /tʃ/ is written as 'ch'
- /j/ is written as 'y'

Long vowels are marked with a circumflex:
- /ii/ becomes 'î'
- /uu/ becomes 'û'

Example: /tʃoko/ is written as "choco"

The orthography is largely phonemic, making it relatively easy to read and write once the basic rules are learned.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Zashuni is an agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes. Key morphosyntactic features include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: singular (-o) and plural (-hu)
   - Case: nominative (-o), accusative (-u), genitive (-nin)
   - Definiteness: definite (-sa), indefinite (-ra)

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense: present (-sa), past (-han), future (-tu)
   - Person and number agreement: 1SG (-u), 2SG (-bu), 3SG (-i), 1PL (-a), 3PL (-nen)
   - Voice: active (-i), passive (-u)

3. Adjectives:
   - Comparative: -ton
   - Superlative: -pon

4. Other markers:
   - Locative: -u
   - Subordinate: -ta

Zashuni does not mark gender grammatically and lacks an inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns.

SYNTAX

Zashuni follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: NA (Noun-Adjective)
2. Adposition-Noun order: PN (Preposition-Noun)
3. Relative clauses are marked with the particle 'a' and follow the noun they modify
4. Negation is expressed using the particle 'ne' before the verb

The VSO order, combined with the NA adjective order, gives Zashuni a distinct syntactic profile that sets it apart from many other languages.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showing the orthography, gloss, and English translation:

1. Zarusai maco cubomoo a soceponoosa reze cucasio taginin.

These examples demonstrate various aspects of Zashuni grammar, including VSO word order, case marking, tense marking, and the use of particles and affixes.
