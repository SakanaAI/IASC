# Sample handbooks.

This directory contains some samples of handbooks for generated languages.

The naming convention for the files is

`G_P_S.txt`

where `G` is the language chosen as the grammatical basis, `P` the language chosen as the
phonotactic basis and `S` is the script used for the orthography.

The handbooks in these examples were created by Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
