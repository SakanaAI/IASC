TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Sanalang

PHONOLOGY

Sanalang has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features several distinctive sounds, including the dental fricative /θ/, the palatal nasal /ɲ/, and the palatal lateral approximant /ʎ/. The presence of both a tap /ɾ/ and a trill /r/ is also noteworthy.

Syllable structure appears to be primarily CV, though some consonant clusters are permitted.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Sanalang uses an Arabic-inspired script for its writing system. Each phoneme is represented by a unique character:

Consonants:
p پ, b ب, t ت, d د, k ک, g گ, f ف, θ ث, s س, x خ, tʃ چ,
m م, n ن, ɲ ڽ, l ل, ʎ ڵ, ɾ ر, r ڕ, j ي, ʝ ژ

Vowels:
a ا, e ە, i ی, o ۆ, u و

The script is written from right to left, following the Arabic tradition. Diacritical marks are not used, making the script relatively simple to learn and use.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Sanalang exhibits a rich morphological system, particularly in its verbal inflections:

1. Nouns:
   - Number: Singular (-nۆ) and plural (-ری) markers
   - No case marking

2. Verbs:
   - Tense-aspect: Non-past (-سا), immediate past (-رۆ), recent past (-سا), remote past (-سی)
   - Person agreement: 1SG (-دۆ), 2SG (-لی), 3SG (-سۆ), 1PL (-را), 3PL (-نۆس)
   - Other markers: Relative clause (-لەس), Negative (-ران)

3. Pronouns:
   - Inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person plural (1PLINCL سی, 1PLEXCL نەر)

4. Adjectives:
   - Comparative (رە), Equative (رۆ), and Superlative (نا) forms

5. Numeral classifiers are used, though specific forms are not provided in the lexicon.

SYNTAX

Sanalang follows an Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) word order for main clauses, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun (AN) order
2. Preposition-Noun (PN) order
3. Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -لەس on the verb

The language uses postpositions for some grammatical functions, such as سۆنا for "to" or "towards".

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few example sentences from the provided text, showcasing various aspects of Sanalang grammar:

1. سۆدی دەنۆ رە ەسسانۆ سۆلۆ ۆبرۆ سۆنانۆ وگنا نۆساساسۆلەس نۆساساسۆ
   so.di de.no ɾe es.sa-no so.lo ob.ɾo so.na-no ug.na no.sa-sa-so-les no.sa-sa-so
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

2. سۆلۆ سۆدی ارنونۆ سۆدی ەبداری نۆنەسانۆس
   so.lo so.di aɾ.nu-no so.di eb.da-ɾi no.ne-sa-nos
   in the park-SING the child-PLUR play-RECPAST-3PL
   "The children played in the park."

3. نۆلۆ ەرنا سەنو سۆدی ەترانۆ سالاساسۆ
   no.lo eɾ.na se.nu so.di et.ɾa-no sa.la-sa-so
   at eight o'clock the movie-SING start-NPAST-3SG
   "The movie starts at eight o'clock."

These examples demonstrate the OVS word order, noun and verb inflections, and the use of postpositions.
