TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zaru

PHONOLOGY

Zaru has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for consonant clusters and diphthongs. Syllable structure appears to be (C)V(C), with most words following a CV pattern.

Notable features:
- The presence of both /s/ and /ʃ/, as well as /z/
- Inclusion of the affricate /tʃ/
- Lack of /l/, with /r/ likely filling both roles
- A balanced five-vowel system

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zaru uses an Arabic-inspired script, with some modifications to accommodate its phonological system. Consonants are represented by full letters, while vowels are typically indicated by diacritical marks above or below the consonants.

Some key features:
- Vowels at the beginning of words or following another vowel use alif (ا) as a carrier
- The script is written from right to left
- Some letters have been adapted or borrowed from other Arabic-script languages to represent sounds not found in Arabic, such as /p/ (پ) and /tʃ/ (چ)

Examples:
زَرٗ (za.ru) - "be"
كَتٗ (ka.tu) - "flower"
سُكِ (so.ke) - "smart"
