TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Neosyllabic

PHONOLOGY

Neosyllabic has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features both voiced and voiceless plosives, as well as a range of fricatives including the dental fricative θ. It has a palatal nasal ɲ and lateral ʎ, which are somewhat uncommon cross-linguistically. The presence of both a tap ɾ and trill r is also noteworthy.

The vowel system is a standard five-vowel system common to many languages worldwide.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Neosyllabic uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some key correspondences include:

- ου represents /u/
- τσ represents /tʃ/
- νι represents /ɲ/
- λι represents /ʎ/
- ρρ represents /r/ (trill)
- γι represents /ʝ/

The orthography is largely phonemic, with each sound having a unique representation. One notable rule is the use of final ς instead of σ at the end of words.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Neosyllabic has a rich system of verbal morphology but relatively simple nominal morphology.

Nouns are marked for number (singular -νο, plural -ρι) but not for case.

Verbs are marked for tense-aspect and person agreement. The tense-aspect system includes:

- Non-past (-σα)
- Immediate past (-ρο)
- Recent past (-σα)
- Remote past (-σι)

Person agreement is marked for both subject and object, following an ergative-absolutive pattern:

Subject (ergative):
1SG: -δο, 2SG: -λι, 3SG: -σο, 1PL: -ρα, 3PL: -νος

Object (absolutive):
1SG: -δο, 2SG: -λι, 3SG: -σο, 1PL: -ρα, 3PL: -νος

Other notable morphemes include:
- Negation: -ραν
- Relative clause marker: -λες

The language distinguishes between inclusive (σι) and exclusive (νερ) first person plural pronouns.

Neosyllabic uses numeral classifiers, which are placed between the noun and the number.

SYNTAX

Neosyllabic has an unusual Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) word order for main clauses. This is a rare word order, found in only about 1% of the world's languages.

Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN order), and adpositions precede their noun phrases (PN order).

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few example sentences from the provided text:

1. Σοδι δενο ρε εσσανο σολο οβρο σονανο ουγνα νοσασασολες νοσασασο.
   so.di de.no ɾe es.sa-no so.lo ob.ɾo so.na-no ug.na no.sa-sa-so-les no.sa-sa-so .
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG .
   "The smartest student in our school is he."

2. Σοδι νασδι να εγιρανο ερνο οσνισαδολες ουνλα νοσασασο.
   so.di nas.di na eʝ.ɾa-no eɾ.no os.ni-sa-do-les un.la no.sa-sa-so .
   the delicious SUP cake-SING i taste-RECPAST-1SG-REL this be-NPAST-3SG .
   "This is the most delicious cake I have tasted."

3. Νασα δουσινο ουπδα ριραρανσασο.
   na.sa du.si-no up.da ɾi.ɾa-ɾan-sa-so .
   spicy food-SING she like-NEG-NPAST-3SG .
   "Spicy food, she doesn't like."

These examples showcase the OVS word order, the use of superlatives (να), and the negation marker (-ραν).
