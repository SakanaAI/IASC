TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Cyrillic Ergative (CyrErg)

PHONOLOGY

CyrErg has a phonological inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features a mix of common and less common sounds. Notable features include:
- The dental fricative θ (as in English "think")
- The palatal nasal ɲ (as in Spanish "ñ")
- The palatal lateral approximant ʎ (as in Italian "gli")
- The alveolar tap ɾ and trill r contrast (as in Spanish)
- The palatal approximant j and fricative ʝ contrast

The syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), allowing for some consonant clusters.

ORTHOGRAPHY

CyrErg uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet. Each phoneme is represented by a single letter, with some adaptations:

p: п, b: б, t: т, d: д, k: к, g: г, f: ф, θ: ѳ, s: с, x: х, tʃ: ч,
m: м, n: н, ɲ: њ, l: л, ʎ: љ, ɾ: р, r: р, j: й, ʝ: ј,
a: а, e: е, i: и, o: о, u: у

Note that ɾ and r are both represented by р, as the distinction is not considered phonemic in the orthography.

MORPHOSYNTAX

CyrErg is an ergative-absolutive language with a rich case system and complex verbal agreement. Key features include:

1. Case marking: Ergative (ERG), Absolutive (ABS), Genitive (GEN), and Instrumental (INS) cases are marked using postpositional words.

2. Number: The language distinguishes singular and plural, but not dual.

3. Verbal agreement: Verbs agree with both the ergative and absolutive arguments in person and number. The markers are:
   ERG: 1SG: -орру, 2SG: -адло, 3SG: -сало, 1PL: -орру, 2PL: -адло, 3PL: -сало
   ABS: 1SG: -лела, 2SG: -лела, 3SG: -лела, 1PL: -дера, 2PL: -дера, 3PL: -дера

4. Tense-Aspect: Not marked morphologically.

5. Negation: Marked by the suffix -ро on verbs.

6. Relativization: Marked by the suffix -нир on the head noun.

7. Comparison: Comparative (COMP) and equative (EQU) constructions use separate particles.

8. Numeral classifiers: The language employs a classifier system, though specific classifiers are not provided in the sample.

SYNTAX

CyrErg has an unusual Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order, which is relatively rare cross-linguistically. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: Noun-Adjective (NA)
2. Adposition-Noun order: Noun-Postposition (NP)
3. Relative clauses: Head-internal, marked with the suffix -нир on the head noun
4. Comparison constructions: The standard of comparison precedes the adjective

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are two example sentences from the provided text:

1. Ниси син ибре окно лал сесе рос рисанир асну рос ресо умна орру лела .
   smart COMP student we ERG school ABS in-REL he ABS is with first singular .
   "We are smarter students than he is in school."

2. Нели ефди осла ехсонир дала рено серос не дала лера рос ресо умна сало лела .
   new phone old model-REL as twice expensive EQU as the ABS is with third singular .
   "The new phone is twice as expensive as the old model."

These examples demonstrate the OSV word order, postpositional case marking, and complex verbal agreement system of CyrErg.
