TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Thraenian

PHONOLOGY

Thraenian has a rich phonemic inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language distinguishes between voiced and voiceless consonants, and includes several fricatives and affricates. Notable features include the lateral fricative ɬ and its voiceless counterpart ɬ̥, as well as a voiceless trill r̥.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system is quite extensive, featuring both monophthongs and diphthongs. It includes central vowels like ə and ɨ, as well as the near-open front unrounded vowel æ.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Thraenian uses a modified Arabic script for its orthography. Some notable correspondences include:

- ɬ is represented by ڵ
- ɬ̥ is represented by ڶ
- r̥ is represented by ڕ
- ŋ is represented by ڭ

Vowels are represented by both standard Arabic vowel letters and additional characters:

- ɛ and æ are both represented by ە
- ɨ is represented by ى
- ə is represented by ə (retained from IPA)

Diphthongs are represented by combinations of vowel characters:
- aɪ is اي
- aʊ is او
- ɔɪ is ۆي

MORPHOSYNTAX

Thraenian is an agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes. Key features include:

1. Number: Singular (-fək), Plural (-wəl), and Dual (-nit) are marked on nouns.

2. Case: Nominative (-el), Accusative (-kə), Genitive (-vɔdʒ), and Locative (-θɔ) are marked on nouns.

3. Definiteness: Definite (-fɔɪg) and Indefinite (-ðeb) markers exist.

4. Tense: Present (-ɔŋ), Past (-lu), and Future (-ɛk) are marked on verbs.

5. Person agreement: Verbs agree with subjects in person and number (e.g., -ʃow for 1SG, -jiv for 2SG, -ɔʃ for 3SG, -ʃi for 1PL, -θɛ for 3PL).

6. Voice: Active (-θɛ) and Passive (-ʃaʊɬ) are marked on verbs.

7. Degree: Comparative (-wuk) and Superlative (-aw) suffixes exist for adjectives.

8. Verbal nouns: The suffix -il is used to form verbal nouns or infinitives.

SYNTAX

Thraenian follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order).
2. Adpositions precede their noun complements (PN order).
3. Relative clauses are introduced by the particle 'no' and follow the noun they modify.
4. The negation particle 'ko' precedes the verb it negates.
5. Subordinate clauses typically follow the main clause.
