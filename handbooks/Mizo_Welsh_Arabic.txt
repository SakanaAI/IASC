TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Thulāni

PHONOLOGY

Thulāni has a rich phonemic inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several uncommon sounds, including the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative /ɬ/ and its voiceless counterpart /ɬ̥/, as well as a voiceless alveolar trill /r̥/. These sounds add a unique character to the language's phonetic profile.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system includes both monophthongs and diphthongs, with a distinction between tense and lax vowels (e.g., /i/ vs /ɪ/, /u/ vs /ʊ/). The central vowel /ə/ (schwa) and the high central vowel /ɨ/ add to the language's phonetic complexity.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Thulāni uses a modified Arabic script for its orthography. Some notable features include:

1. Vowel representation: Most vowels are represented by full letters rather than diacritics, e.g., 'ا' for /a/, 'ی' for /i/.
2. Additional characters: The script includes modified Arabic letters to represent sounds not found in standard Arabic, such as 'ڤ' for /v/ and 'چ' for /tʃ/.
3. Digraphs: Some sounds are represented by digraphs, e.g., 'اي' for /aɪ/, 'او' for /aʊ/.

The orthography aims to provide a one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes, with a few exceptions for digraphs and special characters.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Thulāni exhibits a complex morphosyntactic structure:

1. Case System: The language uses an ergative-absolutive case system, with additional cases such as genitive and instrumental. Cases are marked by postpositional words.

2. Verbal Agreement: Verbs agree with both the ergative and absolutive arguments in person and number. For example:
   - 1SGERG: First person singular ergative
   - 3PLABS: Third person plural absolutive

3. Number: The language distinguishes between singular and plural, but not dual.

4. Tense-Aspect: Interestingly, Thulāni does not mark tense or aspect on verbs.

5. Negation: Negation is marked by the suffix '-ێک' (-ek).

6. Relativization: Relative clauses are formed using the suffix '-نۆ' (-no).

7. Comparison: Comparative and superlative forms are marked by 'مəن' (mən) and 'ࢨک' (ɪk) respectively.

SYNTAX

Thulāni follows an Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. This order is consistently maintained in main clauses.

Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA).
2. Adposition-Noun order: Postpositions are used instead of prepositions (NP).
3. Subordinate clauses: These typically precede the main clause.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various features of Thulāni:

1. ثرکوس مəن خەسə نۇخاي نࢧب پليۆڤ مو فلدəننۆ ستمام مو رəذو سنپۆر گونəڭ لاوبەن
   θrkus mən χɛ.sə nʊ.χaɪ næb pljov mu fldən-no stmam mu rə.ðu snpɔr gwnəŋ laʊ.bɛn
   smart COMP student we ERG school ABS in-REL he ABS is with first singular
   "We are smarter than the student who is in school."

This sentence demonstrates the comparative construction, ergative-absolutive case marking, and a relative clause.

2. وࢩفə ࢨک برڭێڤ کرفࢧگ نࢧب مو تࢨفۆ کرتۆثنۆ فرگەپ مو رəذو سنپۆر گرنايم لاوبەن
   wɨ.fə ɪk brŋev krfæg næb mu tɪ.fɔ krtoθ-no frgɛp mu rə.ðu snpɔr grnaɪm laʊ.bɛn
   hot SUP day year ERG ABS so far-REL today ABS is with third singular
   "Today is the hottest day of the year so far."

This example shows the superlative construction and the use of the ergative case with an inanimate subject.

3. چࢨيا فەيا کࢨڤۆ نࢧب دۆنəێک سنپۆر گونəڭ لاوبەن
   tʃɪ.ja fɛ.ja kɪ.vɔ næb do.nə-ek snpɔr gwnəŋ laʊ.bɛn
   very well i ERG swim-NEG with first singular
   "I don't swim very well."

This sentence illustrates the negation suffix and first-person singular ergative agreement on the verb.
