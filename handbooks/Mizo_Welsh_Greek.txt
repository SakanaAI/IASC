TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Neokosmos

PHONOLOGY

Neokosmos has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several uncommon consonants, including the voiceless lateral fricative ɬ, its devoiced counterpart ɬ̥, and a devoiced trill r̥. These sounds add a unique flavor to the language's phonetic profile.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system includes both monophthongs and diphthongs, providing a wide range of vocalic distinctions. The presence of both tense and lax vowels (e.g., i/ɪ, u/ʊ) allows for subtle phonemic contrasts.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Neokosmos uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography, with some unique adaptations:

- Most consonants have straightforward Greek letter equivalents (e.g., π for p, τ for t).
- Some digraphs are used for complex sounds (e.g., τς for tʃ, τζ for dʒ).
- Vowels generally follow Greek conventions, with some extensions (e.g., οϋ for u).
- Diacritics are used in specific contexts, such as the diaeresis (ϋ) to mark certain vowel sequences.
- The final sigma rule is applied, with ς used word-finally instead of σ.

This orthographic system allows for a visually distinct writing system while maintaining some familiarity for those acquainted with the Greek alphabet.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Neokosmos exhibits an ergative-absolutive case system, which is relatively uncommon among the world's languages. The main cases are:

- Ergative (ERG): Marks the subject of transitive verbs
- Absolutive (ABS): Marks the object of transitive verbs and the subject of intransitive verbs
- Genitive (GEN): Indicates possession
- Instrumental (INS): Marks the instrument used in an action

Case is marked using postpositional words, rather than affixes or prefixes.

Verbs show agreement with both ergative and absolutive arguments, distinguishing person and number. For example:

- 1SGERG: First person singular ergative
- 3PLABS: Third person plural absolutive

The language does not mark tense or aspect on verbs, relying instead on context or temporal adverbs to convey such information.

Neokosmos also employs a classifier system, adding an extra layer of nominal categorization.

SYNTAX

The basic word order in Neokosmos is OSV (Object-Subject-Verb), which is quite rare among the world's languages. This order is consistently applied in both main and subordinate clauses.

Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and adpositions are postpositions, coming after the noun phrase they govern (NP order).

These syntactic features combine to create a highly head-final language structure, where modifiers and complements generally precede their heads.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing the unique features of Neokosmos:

1. Θρκοϋς μεν χεσε νυχαι ναβ πλιωβ μοϋ φλδεννω στμαμ μοϋ ρεδοϋ σνπορ γωνεγγ λαϋβεν.
   smart COMP student we ERG school ABS in-REL he ABS is with first singular
   "We are smarter than the student who is in school."

2. Ωεσοϋ γωριτ σκτςιδ κρλλωμνω γεση δυφι θργιχι γεγ γεση λονε μοϋ ρεδοϋ σνπορ γρναιμ λαϋβεν.
   new phone old model-REL as twice expensive EQU as the ABS is with third singular
   "The new phone is twice as expensive as the old model."

3. Τςατςο ςιθο κρσυβ νυχαι ναβ ρηκωλλ θερε νονυ νολι σνπορ γρναιμ λαϋβεν.
   climate change country we ERG together address needs to with third singular
   "We need to address climate change in our country together."

These examples demonstrate the OSV word order, postpositional case marking, and the use of relational particles like -νω (REL) and comparative constructions.
