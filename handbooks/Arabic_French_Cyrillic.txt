TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Cyrillic Vostokan

PHONOLOGY

Cyrillic Vostokan has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features several distinctive phonological characteristics:
1. A three-way contrast in nasal vowels (ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃)
2. The presence of both front rounded (y, œ, ø) and back rounded (u, o, ɔ) vowels
3. A uvular fricative (ʁ) alongside the more common alveolar liquid (l)
4. Palatal (ɲ) and labio-palatal (ɥ) consonants

This phonemic inventory allows for a wide range of distinctive sounds, contributing to the language's unique character.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Cyrillic Vostokan uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet to represent its sounds. Some notable features include:

1. Use of ъ to represent the schwa (ə)
2. Repurposing of ѳ for the open-mid back rounded vowel (ɔ)
3. Use of њ for the palatal nasal (ɲ)
4. Representation of nasal vowels with distinct characters (ѧ, ѫ, ѩ)

The orthography aims to provide a one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes, with a few exceptions. This system allows for accurate representation of the language's sounds while maintaining a Cyrillic aesthetic.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Cyrillic Vostokan exhibits a rich morphological system with both fusional and agglutinative features. Key morphosyntactic characteristics include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: Singular (-лѳ), Plural (-на), and Dual (-э)
   - Case: Nominative (-ас), Accusative (-пе), Genitive (-шър)

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense-aspect: Present (-нир), Past (-ѳр), Future (-е)
   - Person agreement: Ergative-Absolutive alignment (e.g., -рѳн for 3SG.ERG, -тэл for 1SG.ABS)

3. Other features:
   - Definiteness marking: Definite (дём-...-тан), Indefinite (-сир)
   - Comparison: Comparative (-ы), Superlative (-он)
   - Voice: Active (-ѳ), Passive (-ер)

The language makes extensive use of suffixes for grammatical marking, with some prefixing (e.g., for definiteness). This results in potentially long, information-rich word forms.

SYNTAX

Cyrillic Vostokan follows a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Noun-Adjective order (NA): Adjectives follow the nouns they modify
2. Preposition-Noun order (PN): Adpositions precede their noun complements

These word order characteristics create a consistent head-initial pattern across different phrase types. Modifiers and complements generally follow their heads, contributing to a right-branching syntactic structure.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are two example sentences from the provided text, showcasing the language's orthography, morphosyntax, and syntax:

1. Гркинниррѳн кама дёмдебулѳ ым блрёмонлѳастан раси дёмврўэнлѳ кеюѳшър.
   gʁkin-niʁ-ʁɔn ka.ma dœm-de.bu-lɔ ym blʁœm-on-lɔ-as-tan ʁa.si dœm-vʁwɛn-lɔ ke.ɥɔ-ʃəʁ
   be-PRES-3SG he DEF-student-SING REL smart-SUP-SING-NOM-DEF in DEF-school-SING we-GEN
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

2. Денѧнируѳ дёмтрсирна порэ дёмснлъкнашър раси дрсасшър.
   de.nɑ̃-niʁ-u-ɔ dœm-tʁsiʁ-na po.ʁɛ dœm-snlək-na-ʃəʁ ʁa.si dʁsas-ʃəʁ
   fall-PRES-3PL-ACT DEF-leaf-PLUR from DEF-tree-PLUR-GEN in autumn-GEN
   "The leaves fall from the trees in autumn."

These examples demonstrate the VSO word order, case marking, tense-aspect marking, and the use of definite articles and relative clauses.
