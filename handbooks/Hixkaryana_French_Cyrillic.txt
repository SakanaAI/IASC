TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Cyrillic

PHONOLOGY

Cyrillic has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels (y, œ, ø). The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, giving the language a somewhat French-like quality in its phonology.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Cyrillic uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Some notable correspondences include:

- /ɥ/ is represented by ю
- /w/ is represented by ў
- /ə/ is represented by ъ
- /ɛ/ is represented by э
- /œ/ is represented by ё
- /ɔ/ is represented by ѳ
- /ɑ̃/ is represented by ѧ
- /ɔ̃/ is represented by ѫ
- /ɛ̃/ is represented by ѩ
- /ø/ is represented by ѳ

This orthography allows for a unique visual representation of the language while maintaining a connection to Cyrillic-using cultures.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Cyrillic exhibits an ergative-absolutive alignment in its verbal morphology. The language marks tense-aspect through suffixes, with four distinctions: nonpast, immediate past, recent past, and remote past.

Nouns are marked for number (singular and plural) but not for case. The language features an inclusive-exclusive distinction in first-person plural pronouns.

Verbal agreement is complex, with markers for both ergative and absolutive arguments:

- Ergative markers: -йек (1SG), -ѳ (2SG), -е (3SG), -бен (1PL), -ръм (3PL)
- Absolutive markers are not explicitly shown in the provided examples

Other notable morphological features include:

- Relative clause marker: -э
- Negation marker: -ёс
- Comparative: кас
- Equative: ас
- Superlative: е

SYNTAX

Cyrillic has an unusual Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) main word order, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. Adjectives precede nouns (AN), and the language uses prepositions (PN).

Example of OVS order:
расает ўади йенѫет гртѳсёсюате
food-SING the cat-SING eat-NEG-NPAST-3SG
"The cat doesn't eat its food."

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text:

1. Ўади сэсъ кас низеет пѳре блфър грдърет дртан серыюатеэ серыюате.
   the smart COMP student-SING in our school-SING he be-NPAST-3SG-REL be-NPAST-3SG
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

2. Клним ўади глпену пѳре тэде ўади гржѩму сптѳсюатръм.
   from the tree-PLUR in autumn the leaf-PLUR fall-NPAST-3PL
   "The leaves fall from the trees in autumn."

3. Нёру снкър ѳкыты вртефѩет дрнѫл ўаса флкесет рим смсанембен тррал блпик.
   with a different contractor-SING for this project-SING 1PLEXCL decide-RECPAST-1PL to go
   "We decided to go with a different contractor for this project."

These examples showcase the OVS word order, the use of case markers and tense-aspect suffixes, and the inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns.
