TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Elythrian

PHONOLOGY

Elythrian has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language includes some less common sounds like the palatal nasal ɲ, palatal lateral ʎ, and palatal fricative ʝ. It also distinguishes between a tap ɾ and trill r.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Elythrian uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Most letters correspond directly to their IPA equivalents, with a few exceptions:

- ου represents /u/
- τσ represents /tʃ/
- νι represents /ɲ/
- λι represents /ʎ/
- ρρ represents /r/ (trill)
- γι represents /ʝ/

Word-final sigma is written as ς instead of σ.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Elythrian is a highly agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes. Nouns are marked for number (singular/plural) and case (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, ablative, locative, instrumental). Verbs are marked for tense (present, past, future), aspect (perfective/imperfective), mood (indicative, conditional), person, and number.

Some notable features:
- No gender system
- Extensive use of case marking
- Complex verb conjugation system
- Use of classifiers with numbers

Examples of morphological markers:
- Plural: -σα
- Nominative: -ρεν
- Accusative: -νε
- Past tense: -λα
- Future tense: -λεν
- 3rd person singular: -σαλ

SYNTAX

Elythrian follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order. Other syntactic features include:

- Adjectives precede nouns (AN order)
- Postpositions are used instead of prepositions (NP order)
- Relative clauses are formed using the suffix -νεν on the verb
- Subordinate clauses generally precede the main clause
