TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Neofrancic

PHONOLOGY

Neofrancic has a rich phonological inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded front vowels (y, œ, ø), giving it a distinctly French-like quality. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, further reinforcing this impression.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Neofrancic uses a modified Latin alphabet. Some notable features include:

- 'c' represents /k/
- 'ch' represents /ʃ/
- 'j' represents /ʒ/
- 'ń' represents /ɲ/
- 'r' represents /ʁ/
- 'y' represents /j/
- 'ü' represents /ɥ/
- 'ou' represents /u/
- 'oe' represents /œ/
- 'eu' represents /ø/
- Nasal vowels are marked with a cedilla: 'ą' /ɑ̃/, 'ǫ' /ɔ̃/, 'ę' /ɛ̃/

This orthography allows for a relatively close correspondence between spelling and pronunciation while maintaining some familiar elements from languages like French.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Neofrancic is a highly agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes. Key features include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: singular (-lò), plural (-na), dual (-è)
   - Case: nominative (-as), accusative (-pé), genitive (-cher)
   - Definiteness: definite (-tan), indefinite (-cir)

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense: present (-nir), past (-òr), future (-é)
   - Aspect: active (-ò)
   - Person agreement: 1sg (-tèl), 2sg (-i), 3sg (-ròn), 1pl (-ò), 3pl (-ou)

3. Other markers:
   - Comparative: -u
   - Superlative: -on
   - Locative: -téc
   - Passive: -ér
   - Subordinate: -in

Neofrancic does not mark grammatical gender and lacks an inclusive-exclusive distinction in pronouns. It does, however, employ a system of numeral classifiers.

SYNTAX

Neofrancic follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: NA (Noun-Adjective)
2. Adposition-Noun order: PN (Preposition-Noun)

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle 'um' and follow the noun they modify.
