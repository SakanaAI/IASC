TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Krylovik

PHONOLOGY

Krylovik has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language features several uncommon consonants, including the voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ and its devoiced counterpart /ɬ̥/, as well as a devoiced trill /r̥/. The presence of both dental and alveolar fricatives (/θ/ and /s/) is also noteworthy.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system is quite extensive, including both tense and lax vowels, a central vowel /ə/, and three diphthongs. The presence of both /i/ and /ɨ/ is particularly interesting, as it allows for fine distinctions in vowel quality.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Krylovik uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

1. Use of 'ң' for the velar nasal /ŋ/
2. 'ѳ' represents the dental fricative /θ/
3. 'џ' is used for the affricate /dʒ/
4. 'ԓ' represents the lateral fricative /ɬ/
5. Diacritics are used to represent some vowels: 'ӥ' for /ɪ/, 'ӧ' for /ɔ/, 'ӯ' for /ʊ/, 'ӕ' for /æ/

This orthography allows for a clear representation of the language's phonemic distinctions while maintaining a Cyrillic aesthetic.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Krylovik exhibits a rich agglutinative morphology with both nominal and verbal inflection.

Nominal Morphology:
- Number: Singular (-нӯ) and Plural (-рәп)
- Case: Nominative (-аўр̥), Accusative (-ңэк), Dative (-еў), Genitive (-ђӯ), Ablative (-ун), Locative (-һи), Instrumental (-рең)

Verbal Morphology:
- Tense: Present (-ат), Past (-рӥ), Future (-кӧн)
- Aspect: Perfective (-џач)
- Mood: Indicative (-уг), Conditional (-мӯѳ)
- Voice: Active (-џач), Passive (-мо)
- Person agreement: 1SG (-џэр), 2SG (-айм), 3SG (-лал), 1PL (-оф), 3PL (-ӧл)

Other notable morphemes:
- Negation: -кай
- Relativizer: -ўе

The language also uses classifiers, though the specific system is not detailed in the provided information.

SYNTAX

Krylovik follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order, which is typical for agglutinative languages. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: Adjectives precede the nouns they modify
2. Postpositions: Adpositions follow their noun phrases
3. Relative clauses: Marked with the -ўе suffix on the verb, likely preceding the head noun

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various aspects of Krylovik grammar:

1. Маўшәаўр̥ гўтӧгђӯ шусинӯһи рич глфэһ трчэснӯаўр̥ дуђэаўр̥ гечэатуглалџач.
   he-NOM we-GEN school-SING-LOC COMP smart student-SING-NOM the-NOM be-PRES-IND-3SG-ACT
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

This sentence demonstrates the use of case marking (nominative, genitive, locative), as well as verbal morphology for present tense, indicative mood, and third-person singular agreement.

2. Гўтӧгаўр̥ фрнуў клңӯгђӯ йакукнӯһи хилэ блтӯкатофџач строк, кура прнӧгнӯаўр̥ дуђэаўр̥ нуԓ̥ӧ гечэкӧнмӯѳлалџач.
   we-NOM next week-GEN vacation-SING-LOC on go-PRES-1PL-ACT are, so office-SING-NOM the-NOM closed be-FUT-COND-3SG-ACT
   "We are going on vacation next week, so the office will be closed."

This example shows the use of future tense and conditional mood, as well as the SOV word order and postpositional structure.

3. Снбэўаўр̥ рәўэ римонӯңэк тотӧкайатуглалџач.
   she-NOM spicy food-SING-ACC like-NEG-PRES-IND-3SG-ACT
   "She doesn't like spicy food."

This sentence demonstrates the use of the negative suffix -кай in verbal morphology.
