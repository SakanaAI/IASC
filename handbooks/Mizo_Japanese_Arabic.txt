TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Sitara

PHONOLOGY

Sitara has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for syllable structures of CV, CVC, and V. Consonant clusters are not permitted within syllables. Stress typically falls on the penultimate syllable of a word.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Sitara uses a modified Arabic script for its writing system. Each phoneme is represented by a unique character:

Consonants:
k: ك, s: س, t: ت, n: ن, h: ه, m: م, r: ر, g: غ, z: ز, d: د, b: ب, p: پ, ʃ: ش, tʃ: چ, j: ي, w: و

Vowels:
a: ا, o: و, u: ُ, e: ِ, i: ي

Some vowel combinations have special representations:
ao: او
ae: اے

Words are written from right to left, following Arabic script conventions. Vowels are typically written as full letters rather than diacritics, making the script more readable for learners.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Sitara employs an ergative-absolutive case system, marked by postpositional words. The main cases are:

- Ergative (ERG): را (ra)
- Absolutive (ABS): ُ (u)
- Instrumental (INS): بان (ban)

The language does not mark grammatical gender or have an inclusive-exclusive distinction for pronouns. It does, however, use numeral classifiers, though the specific system is not detailed in the provided information.

Verbs in Sitara do not mark tense or aspect morphologically. Instead, the language uses a complex system of person agreement markers for both ergative and absolutive arguments:

Ergative markers: 1SGERG, 2SGERG, 3SGERG, 1PLERG, 2PLERG, 3PLERG
Absolutive markers: 1SGABS, 2SGABS, 3SGABS, 1PLABS, 2PLABS, 3PLABS

These markers are attached to the verb, indicating the person and number of both the subject and object.

Additional morphosyntactic markers include:
- Negation (-NEG): -ي (-i)
- Relative clause marker (-REL): -ا (-a)
- Comparative (COMP): هِن (hen)
- Equative (EQU): تُ (tu)
- Superlative (SUP): غو (go)

SYNTAX

Sitara follows an Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) word order for its main clauses. This is a relatively rare word order among the world's languages, making Sitara typologically interesting.

Adjectives follow the nouns they modify (NA order), and adpositions come after their noun phrases (NP order). These postpositional phrases typically precede the verb in a sentence.

Example of basic word order:
تُهو تاپو مُشُ را رُشاي سِتا هُشا سانسو
tu.ho ta.po mu.ʃu ra ru.ʃa-i se.ta hu.ʃa sa.nso
food its cat ERG eat-NEG with third singular
"The cat doesn't eat its food."

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are a few examples from the provided text, showcasing various aspects of Sitara grammar:

1. هوكِ هِن نابي سيتا را رُغُ ُ شوشوا هاما ُ هادا سِتا كوزا سانسو
ho.ke hen na.bi si.ta ra ru.gu u ʃo.ʃo-a ha.ma u ha.da se.ta ko.za sa.nso
smart COMP student we ERG school ABS in-REL he ABS is with first singular
"We are smarter students than he is in school."

This example demonstrates the comparative construction, ergative-absolutive case marking, and the relative clause marker.

2. ويدُ سِهِ بُكا ُ شوشو غُسا سِتا هُشا كُكي
wi.du se.he bu.ka u ʃo.ʃo gu.sa se.ta hu.ʃa ku.ki
flowers many garden ABS in bloom with third plural
"Many flowers bloom in the garden."

This sentence shows the OSV word order and the use of the absolutive case for intransitive subjects.

3. غاكو را رِمو سومُ سيتا را سُتِ سِتا كوزا كُكي
ga.ko ra re.mo so.mu si.ta ra su.te se.ta ko.za ku.ki
bread ERG loaves two we ERG bought with first plural
"We bought two loaves of bread."

This example illustrates the use of the ergative case for transitive subjects and the placement of numerals after the noun.
