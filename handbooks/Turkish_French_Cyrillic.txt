TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Vornese

PHONOLOGY

Vornese has a rich phonemic inventory with 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded and unrounded front vowels. The consonant inventory includes the uvular fricative /ʁ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/, giving Vornese a distinctive sound profile.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Vornese uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Some notable correspondences include:

- /ɲ/ is represented by њ
- /ʁ/ is represented by р
- /j/ is represented by й
- /ɥ/ is represented by ю
- /w/ is represented by ў
- /ə/ is represented by ъ
- /œ/ is represented by ё
- /ɔ/ is represented by ѳ
- /ɑ̃/ is represented by ѧ
- /ɔ̃/ is represented by ѫ
- /ɛ̃/ is represented by ѩ
- /ø/ is represented by ѳ̈

This orthography allows for a unique visual representation of Vornese while maintaining a connection to existing Cyrillic-based writing systems.

SYNTAX

Vornese follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order for main clauses. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify (AN order), and the language uses postpositions rather than prepositions (NP order).

Example of basic word order:
Бртеткѩс дѫсаэм крнатиулмаут
bʁtet-kɛ̃s dɔ̃.sa-ɛm kʁnat-i-ul-ma-ut
I-NOM you-ACC need-PRES-IND-1SG-ACT
"I need you"
