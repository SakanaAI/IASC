TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Saruvian

PHONOLOGY

Saruvian has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows consonant clusters and diphthongs. Syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), with some more complex structures permitted.

Notable features:
- The presence of both /ʃ/ and /tʃ/ provides a contrast between these similar sounds
- The inclusion of both /w/ and /j/ as semivowels adds phonetic variety
- The five-vowel system is common cross-linguistically and provides a good balance of sounds

ORTHOGRAPHY

Saruvian uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Each phoneme is represented by a single character:

к (k), с (s), т (t), н (n), х (h), м (m), р (r), г (g), з (z), д (d), б (b), п (p), ш (ʃ), ч (tʃ), й (j), в (w)
а (a), о (o), у (u), е (e), и (i)

This orthography provides a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols, making it relatively easy to learn and use. The use of Cyrillic gives the language a distinct visual character while maintaining phonetic clarity.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Saruvian exhibits a rich morphological system with both prefixes and suffixes. Key features include:

1. Number: Singular (-о), Plural (-ху), and Dual (-е) markers
2. Case: Nominative (-о), Accusative (-у), Genitive (-нин)
3. Definiteness: Definite prefix (ку-), Indefinite suffix (-ра)
4. Tense: Present (-са), Past (-хан), Future (-ту)
5. Person agreement: 1SG (-у), 2SG (-бу), 3SG (-и), 1PL (-а), 3PL (-нен)
6. Aspect: Active (-и)
7. Comparison: Comparative (-тон), Superlative (-пон)
8. Other markers: Passive (-у), Subordinate (-та)

Nouns inflect for number, case, and definiteness. Verbs show complex agreement patterns and mark tense and aspect. Adjectives can inflect for case, number, and comparison.

The language uses postpositions, as evidenced by the locative (-у) and genitive (-нин) case markers.

SYNTAX

Saruvian follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. This is a relatively uncommon order cross-linguistically, found in about 9% of the world's languages.

Other syntactic features include:
1. Adjective-Noun: NA (Noun-Adjective) order
2. Adposition-Noun: PN (Preposition-Noun) order

The combination of VSO main order with NA adjective order is particularly rare, occurring in less than 4% of languages globally.

Relative clauses are marked with the particle 'а' and follow the noun they modify.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are two example sentences from the provided text, with orthography, gloss, and English translation:

1. Зарусаи мако кубомоо а сокепонооса резе кукасио тагинин.
   za.ru-sa-i ma.ko ku-bo.mo-o a so.ke-pon-o-o-sa re.ze ku-ka.si-o ta.gi-nin .
   be-PRES-3SG he DEF-student-SING REL smart-SUP-SING-NOM-DEF in DEF-school-SING we-GEN .
   "He is the smartest student in our school."

2. Кизесанени кунегаху сете кугимохунин резе такинин.
   ki.ze-sa-nen-i ku-ne.ga-hu se.te ku-gi.mo-hu-nin re.ze ta.ki-nin .
   fall-PRES-3PL-ACT DEF-leaf-PLUR from DEF-tree-PLUR-GEN in autumn-GEN .
   "The leaves fall from the trees in autumn."

These examples showcase several key features of Saruvian, including VSO word order, complex verbal morphology, and the use of case markers and definiteness prefixes.

LEXICON

A small sample of the Saruvian lexicon:

зару (zaru) - be
чуто (tʃuto) - go
киево (kievo) - eat
мута (muta) - like
сапо (sapo) - live
каху (kahu) - get
мехи (mehi) - see
сопе (sope) - write
кахи (kahi) - build
нира (nira) - chase

муайе (muaje) - house
раку (raku) - book
гоку (goku) - cat
хусу (husu) - dog
деайи (deaji) - day
хоко (hoko) - year
тате (tate) - friend
римо (rimo) - child
йеси (jesi) - man
тесо (teso) - she

This lexicon shows a preference for CVCV syllable structure, though other patterns are also present. The vocabulary items reflect basic concepts and actions, providing a foundation for more complex expressions in the language.
