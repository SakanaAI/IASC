TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Zetakos

PHONOLOGY

Zetakos has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for consonant clusters and diphthongs. Syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), with most words following a CVCV pattern.

Notable features:
- The presence of both /ʃ/ and /tʃ/ allows for a distinction between these sounds.
- The inclusion of both /w/ and /j/ provides for a range of glide sounds.
- The five-vowel system is common among world languages and provides a good balance of vowel sounds.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Zetakos uses a modified Greek alphabet for its writing system. This choice gives the language a unique visual aesthetic while using familiar letter shapes. Some key correspondences include:

- /ʃ/ is represented by ϸ
- /tʃ/ is written as τϸ
- /j/ uses ι
- /w/ is represented by ω

Vowels use their Greek counterparts: α (a), ο (o), υ (u), ε (e), ι (i)

This orthography allows for easy representation of the language's phonemes while giving it a distinct appearance.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Zetakos exhibits a rich morphological system with both prefixes and suffixes. Key features include:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Number: Singular (-o), Plural (-hu), Dual (-e)
   - Case: Nominative (-o), Accusative (-u), Genitive (-nin)
   - Definiteness: Definite (ku-), Indefinite (-ra)

2. Verbal marking:
   - Tense: Present (-sa), Past (-han), Future (-tu)
   - Person agreement: 1SG (-u), 2SG (-bu), 3SG (-i), 1PL (-a), 3PL (-nen)
   - Voice: Active (-i), Passive (-u)

3. Adjectives:
   - Comparative (-ton)
   - Superlative (-pon)

4. Other features:
   - Subordinate marker (-ta)
   - Locative case (-u)

The language makes extensive use of agglutination, with words often carrying multiple affixes to convey grammatical information.

SYNTAX

Zetakos follows a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order, which is less common among world languages but provides a unique structure. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: The adjective follows the noun (NA)
2. Adposition-Noun order: Prepositions are used (PN)
3. Relative clauses: Introduced by the particle "a" and follow the noun they modify
4. Numeral classifiers: Used between numbers and nouns

These features combine to create a distinct syntactic structure that sets Zetakos apart from many natural languages.

EXAMPLE TEXT

Here are two example sentences from the provided text, with orthography, gloss, and English translation:

1. Ζαρυσαι κυσοκιο α ζεγοοοσα ωασεωυτονοοσα ωομο τετα κυιυκεο α χυυιαοοσα.
   be-PRES-3SG DEF-phone-SING REL new-SING-NOM-DEF expensive-COMP-SING-NOM-DEF twice as DEF-model-SING REL old-SING-NOM-DEF.
   "The new phone is twice as expensive as the old model."

2. Κιζεσανενι κυνεγαχυ σετε κυγιμοχυνιν ρεζε τακινιν.
   fall-PRES-3PL-ACT DEF-leaf-PLUR from DEF-tree-PLUR-GEN in autumn-GEN.
   "The leaves fall from the trees in autumn."

These examples showcase the VSO word order, the use of case marking, and the relative clause structure of Zetakos.

LEXICON

A small sample of the Zetakos lexicon:

ζαρυ - to be
τϸυτο - to go
κυ- - definite article
-ο - singular/nominative marker
-υ - accusative marker
-νιν - genitive marker
σοκι - phone
ζεγο - new
ωασεωυ - expensive
ιυκε - model
χυυια - old
κιζε - to fall
νεγα - leaf
γιμο - tree
τακι - autumn

This lexicon demonstrates the root forms of words, which then take on various affixes to express grammatical relationships and meanings.
