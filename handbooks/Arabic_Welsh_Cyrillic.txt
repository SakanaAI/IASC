TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Voshlang

PHONOLOGY

Voshlang has a rich phonemic inventory with 26 consonants and 15 vowels:

Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, θ, s, ʃ, χ, v, ð, l, r, w, j, tʃ, dʒ, ɬ, h, ɬ̥, r̥

The language includes several less common sounds like the voiceless lateral fricative ɬ and its devoiced counterpart ɬ̥, as well as a devoiced trill r̥. The presence of both θ and ð is relatively rare cross-linguistically.

Vowels: a, ɛ, e, i, ɪ, ɔ, o, u, ʊ, ə, ɨ, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ, æ

The vowel system is quite extensive, including both the common five-vowel system (a, e, i, o, u) and additional distinctions like the near-close vowels ɪ and ʊ. The language also features three diphthongs: aɪ, aʊ, and ɔɪ.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Voshlang uses a modified Cyrillic alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

- The use of ң for the velar nasal ŋ
- ѳ represents θ, while ђ represents ð
- ў is used for w
- џ represents dʒ
- ԓ is used for ɬ, with ԓ̥ for the devoiced variant
- р̥ represents the devoiced trill r̥
- ӥ, ө, ӯ, ә, and ы represent ɪ, o, ʊ, ə, and ɨ respectively
- ӕ is used for æ

This orthography allows for a unique visual representation of Voshlang's phonology while maintaining some familiarity for speakers of languages using Cyrillic scripts.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Voshlang exhibits a complex agglutinative morphology with a rich system of affixes. Key features include:

1. Nominal morphology:
   - Number: Singular (-фәк), Plural (-ўәл), and Dual (-нит)
   - Case: Nominative (-ел), Accusative (-кә), Genitive (-воџ)
   - Definiteness: Definite (-фойг), Indefinite (-ђеб)

2. Verbal morphology:
   - Tense: Present (-оң), Past (-лу), Future (-эк)
   - Aspect: Active (-ѳэ), Passive (-шаўԓ)

4. Other notable affixes:

The language also uses prefixes, such as ер̥- for definiteness.

SYNTAX

Voshlang follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order, which is relatively uncommon among the world's languages. Other syntactic features include:

1. Adjective-Noun order: Nouns precede their modifying adjectives (NA)
2. Adposition-Noun order: Prepositions are used rather than postpositions (PN)
3. Relative clauses: Introduced by the particle нө and follow the noun they modify
