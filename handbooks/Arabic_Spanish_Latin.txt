TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Etlanese

PHONOLOGY

Etlanese has a phoneme inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, θ, s, x, tʃ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʎ, ɾ, r, j, ʝ
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u

The language features several distinctive sounds, including the palatal nasal /ɲ/, the palatal lateral approximant /ʎ/, and the voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/. These sounds add a unique flavor to the phonological system of Etlanese.

The language allows for consonant clusters, particularly in word-initial and word-medial positions. Syllable structure tends to favor CV and CVC patterns, though more complex structures are possible.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Etlanese uses a Latin-based alphabet with some modifications to represent its phonemes. The orthography is largely phonemic, with most letters corresponding directly to a single phoneme. Some notable features include:

- /θ/ is represented by 'th'
- /x/ is represented by 'h'
- /tʃ/ is represented by 'ch'
- /ɲ/ is represented by 'ñ'
- /ʎ/ is represented by 'll'
- /ɾ/ is represented by 'r', while /r/ is represented by 'rr'
- /j/ is represented by 'y'
- /ʝ/ is represented by 'j'

This orthographic system allows for a relatively straightforward relationship between spelling and pronunciation, making it easier for learners to read and write Etlanese.

SYNTAX

Etlanese follows a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order in main clauses. This is relatively uncommon among the world's languages and gives Etlanese a distinctive syntactic flavor. Other word order features include:

1. Adjective-Noun: Etlanese uses a noun-adjective (NA) order, with adjectives following the nouns they modify.

2. Adposition-Noun: The language employs prepositions (PN order), with adpositions preceding their noun complements.

3. Relative clauses: Introduced by the relative pronoun 'rar' and follow the noun they modify.

4. Negation: The negative particle 'san' typically precedes the verb.

5. Subordinate clauses: Often marked by the subordinate suffix -nu on the verb.
