TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Aetherios

PHONOLOGY

Aetherios has a rich phonemic inventory consisting of 20 consonants and 14 vowels:

Consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, m, n, ɲ, l, ʁ, j, ɥ, w
Vowels: i, y, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, œ, ɔ, a, ɑ̃, ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ø

The language features both oral and nasal vowels, as well as rounded and unrounded front vowels. The consonant inventory includes a uvular fricative /ʁ/ and a labio-palatal approximant /ɥ/, which are relatively uncommon cross-linguistically.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Aetherios uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some notable features include:

- The use of 'ου' to represent /u/
- Diacritics to represent different vowel qualities (e.g., 'ε̆' for /ə/, 'ο̈' for /œ/)
- The use of 'ς' for /ʃ/ and 'ζ̧' for /ʒ/
- Nasal vowels represented by adding a tilde to the vowel (e.g., 'α̃' for /ɑ̃/)

This orthography allows for a unique visual representation of the language while maintaining a connection to the Greek alphabet.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Aetherios exhibits a rich morphological system with several notable features:

1. Nominal marking:
   - Singular and plural number distinctions
   - No grammatical case system

2. Verbal marking:
   - Four-way tense distinction: nonpast, immediate past, recent past, and remote past
   - Tense is marked by suffixes
   - Person agreement for both ergative and absolutive arguments

3. Inclusive-exclusive distinction in first-person plural pronouns

4. No grammatical gender

5. Numeral classifiers are used with numbers

Verbs are heavily marked, carrying information about tense, person, and number. For example:

blpik-ῠat-ben (go-NPAST-1PL) "we go"
σερυ-κα-ιεκ (be-REMPAST-1SG) "I was (long ago)"

SYNTAX

Aetherios has an OVS (Object-Verb-Subject) main word order, which is relatively rare among the world's languages. This creates sentences like:

ωαδι σκβυμετ δειοῠατε
wa.di skvym-et de.jɔ-ɥat-e
the movie-SING start-NPAST-3SG
"The movie starts"

Other syntactic features include:

- Adjective-Noun order (AN)
- Preposition-Noun order (PN)

These features combine to create a unique syntactic structure that sets Aetherios apart from many natural languages.
