TITLE: A Grammar and Handbook of Hellenikos

PHONOLOGY

Hellenikos has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 16 consonants and 5 vowels:

Consonants: k, s, t, n, h, m, r, g, z, d, b, p, ʃ, tʃ, j, w
Vowels: a, o, u, e, i

The language allows for some consonant clusters and diphthongs. Notable features include:
- The presence of both /s/ and /ʃ/ (represented as 'ς' in the orthography)
- The affricate /tʃ/
- The approximants /j/ and /w/

The phonotactics seem to favor CV syllable structure, though CVC and VC structures are also present.

ORTHOGRAPHY

Hellenikos uses a modified Greek alphabet for its orthography. Some key features include:

- Most letters correspond directly to their IPA equivalents (e.g., κ = /k/, σ = /s/)
- The letter 'ς' represents /ʃ/
- The digraph 'τς' represents /tʃ/
- 'ι' represents both /i/ and /j/
- 'ω' represents /w/

Some special orthographic rules:
- 'ου' represents /ou/
- 'εα' represents /ea/
- 'αν' represents /anh/ when followed by 'h'

This orthography allows for a clear representation of the language's phonology while maintaining a connection to the Greek alphabet.

MORPHOSYNTAX

Hellenikos exhibits a rich morphological system, particularly in its verbal morphology:

1. Nominal Marking:
   - Number: Singular (-α) and Plural (-σον)
   - No case marking

2. Verbal Marking:
   - Tense-Aspect: Non-past (-ρε), Immediate past (-νι), Recent past (-υ), Remote past (-ο)
   - Person agreement: 1SG (-χο), 2SG (-συν), 3SG (-ρον), 1PL (-α), 3PL (-τα)
   - Other markers: Negative (-γο), Relative (-ι)

3. Inclusive-Exclusive Distinction:
   - 1PLEXCL: σον
   - 1PLINCL: α

4. No grammatical gender

5. Classifiers: The language uses classifiers, though specific examples are not provided in the lexicon.

6. Comparison:
   - Comparative: με
   - Equative: α
   - Superlative: ε

SYNTAX

Hellenikos has the following word order characteristics:

1. Main clause order: OVS (Object-Verb-Subject)
   Example: γοζε καζυα κεμυρερον τινδα χοσα.
            "the wind blows strongly today" (lit. "the wind-SING blow-NPAST-3SG strongly today")

2. Adjective-Noun order: AN (Adjective before Noun)
   Example: κεζα ωυκα
            "smart student"

3. Adposition-Noun order: PN (Preposition before Noun)
   Example: τςετε γοζε ναγοα
            "in the park"

Other syntactic features:
- Relative clauses are marked with the suffix -ι on the verb
- Negation is expressed through the verbal suffix -γο
- Questions are formed by intonation, without changing word order
