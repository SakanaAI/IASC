The Quiet Brook

In a small forest, there was a quiet brook. It flowed gently between mossy rocks and tall trees. The water was clear and cool. Many animals came to drink from the brook every day.

One sunny morning, a young deer named Fawn came to the brook. She was thirsty and wanted a drink. As she bent down to sip the water, she saw her reflection. Fawn thought it was another deer looking back at her. She jumped back, surprised.

Nearby, a wise old owl named Hoot watched from a tree branch. He chuckled softly at Fawn's reaction. Hoot flew down and perched on a rock next to the brook.

"Don't be afraid, little one," Hoot said kindly. "It's just your own reflection in the water."

Fawn looked at Hoot with big, curious eyes. "Really? But it looks so real!"

Hoot nodded. "The quiet brook is like a mirror. It shows us what we look like."

Fawn stepped closer to the water again. This time, she wasn't scared. She watched her reflection move as she moved her head. She smiled, and her reflection smiled back.

"This is fun!" Fawn said happily.

Just then, a playful otter named Splash dove into the brook. The water rippled, and Fawn's reflection became wavy.

"Oh no!" Fawn cried. "The other deer is gone!"

Hoot explained, "Don't worry. When the water settles, you'll see your reflection again."

Splash popped his head out of the water. "Sorry about that! I didn't mean to scare you."

As the water became still once more, Fawn's reflection appeared again. She laughed, realizing it was just her all along.

From that day on, Fawn visited the quiet brook every day. She made friends with Hoot, Splash, and other animals who came to drink. The brook became a special place where they all gathered to play and learn.

Fawn discovered that the quiet brook was more than just water. It was a place of wonder, friendship, and new discoveries. And she knew that, like her reflection, she would always find herself there.
