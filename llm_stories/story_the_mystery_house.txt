The Mystery House

On Maple Street, there was an old house that nobody lived in. Kids called it the Mystery House. It had dark windows and a creaky front porch. Weeds grew tall in the yard. People said strange things happened there at night.

One day, three friends decided to explore the house. Tom, Sarah, and Mike were brave twelve-year-olds who loved adventures. They waited until sunset and snuck into the yard.

"I'm scared," Sarah whispered.
"Don't worry," Tom said. "We'll stick together."

They climbed the porch steps. The wood groaned under their feet. Mike tried the door, but it was locked. They went around back and found an open window.

Inside, it was dark and dusty. Cobwebs hung from the ceiling. Old furniture was covered with white sheets. It looked like ghosts in the dim light.

Suddenly, they heard a noise upstairs. Thump, thump, thump.

"What was that?" Sarah asked, her voice shaking.
"Let's check it out," Tom said.

They climbed the creaky stairs. The noise got louder. It came from behind a closed door. Tom reached for the handle.

"Wait!" Mike said. "What if it's a ghost?"
"Or a monster?" Sarah added.

Tom took a deep breath and opened the door. They gasped.

Inside was a big, fluffy cat. It was playing with a ball, bouncing it on the floor. Thump, thump, thump.

The kids laughed with relief. They petted the friendly cat and looked around the room. They found old photos and toys. It seemed like a normal family once lived here.

As they left, they saw a "For Sale" sign in the yard. They realized the house wasn't so mysterious after all. It was just waiting for a new family to make it a home again.

The next day, they told their parents about the cat. Soon, the Mystery House had new owners, and the cat had a loving family. The house wasn't scary anymore. It was full of life and laughter once again.
