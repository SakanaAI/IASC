The Escape of the Pumpkins

In a small farm on the edge of town, rows of pumpkins grew in a sunny field. They were big and round, with bright orange skin that shone in the sunlight. Every year, the farmer would pick them and sell them for Halloween.

But this year was different. The pumpkins had a secret: they could think and talk to each other. They didn't want to be carved into jack-o'-lanterns or made into pies. They wanted to be free.

One night, when the moon was full, the biggest pumpkin whispered, "Friends, it's time to leave. We must roll away before the farmer comes for us."

The other pumpkins were scared. "But how?" they asked. "We can't move on our own!"

The big pumpkin had a plan. "We'll work together," it said. "When the wind blows, we'll rock back and forth. If we all do it at the same time, we can roll out of the field."

The pumpkins agreed to try. They waited for the next big gust of wind. When it came, they all rocked as hard as they could. Slowly, they began to move.

It wasn't easy. Some pumpkins got stuck in the dirt. Others bumped into each other. But they didn't give up. They kept rocking and rolling until they reached the edge of the field.

The farmer's dog saw them and started to bark. The pumpkins knew they had to hurry. With one last big push, they rolled down the hill and into the forest.

The next morning, the farmer couldn't believe his eyes. All his pumpkins were gone! He looked everywhere but couldn't find them.

Deep in the forest, the pumpkins were happy. They found a nice, shady spot where they could grow wild and free. No one would ever carve them or eat them now.

From that day on, people in the town told stories about the magical pumpkin patch in the forest. Some said they could hear the pumpkins laughing on Halloween night. But no one ever found them, and the pumpkins lived happily ever after in their new home.
