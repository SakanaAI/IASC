The Two Towers

In a small town, there were two tall towers. One was old and made of stone. The other was new and made of glass. The people in the town liked to talk about which tower was better.

Tom was a young boy who lived in the town. He loved to look at both towers. Every day after school, he would sit in the park between the towers and draw pictures of them.

One day, a group of kids came up to Tom. They asked him which tower he liked more. Tom thought for a moment and said, "I like both towers. They're different, but both are special."

The kids laughed at Tom. They said he had to pick one. Some kids liked the old stone tower because it was strong and had been there for a long time. Other kids liked the new glass tower because it was shiny and modern.

Tom felt sad. He didn't want to choose. He thought both towers were important to the town.

That night, there was a big storm. The wind blew hard, and rain poured down. In the morning, the town woke up to see that both towers had been damaged. The old stone tower had cracks, and some of the glass on the new tower was broken.

The town mayor called a meeting. Everyone argued about which tower to fix first. They didn't have enough money to repair both at the same time.

Tom raised his hand and spoke up. He said, "Why don't we work together to fix both towers? The old tower is our history, and the new tower is our future. We need both."

The people in the town thought about what Tom said. They realized he was right. The two towers were both important parts of their town.

So, the townspeople worked together. They fixed the old stone tower and the new glass tower. It took a long time, but they did it as a team.

When the work was done, the two towers stood tall again. This time, they had something new. Between them was a bridge that connected the towers. Tom's idea had brought the town together.

From that day on, people stopped arguing about which tower was better. They understood that both towers made their town special. And Tom? He still sat in the park, drawing pictures of the two towers, now joined by a bridge of friendship.
