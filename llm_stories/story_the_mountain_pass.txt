The Mountain Pass

Jenna looked up at the tall peaks ahead. The mountain pass was the only way to get to the other side. She had to cross it to reach her sick grandmother in the next village.

"It's dangerous," her father had warned. "The path is narrow and steep. There are wild animals up there."

But Jenna was brave. She packed some food, water, and a warm blanket. As the sun rose, she started her journey.

The path began easy enough. Jenna walked through green fields and past small streams. But soon, the ground became rocky. The air got colder as she climbed higher.

By midday, Jenna was tired. She sat on a big rock to eat her lunch. As she munched on her sandwich, she heard a low growl. A large bear was sniffing around nearby!

Jenna's heart raced. She remembered what her mother had taught her: "Stay calm. Don't run. Back away slowly."

She did just that. The bear watched her but didn't follow. Jenna breathed a sigh of relief when she was far enough away.

The path got harder as she went on. In some places, it was so narrow she had to press against the mountain wall. She tried not to look down at the deep drop beside her.

As the sun began to set, Jenna worried. She hadn't reached the other side yet. The wind was getting stronger, and dark clouds were gathering.

Just then, she saw a small cave. "I can stay here for the night," she thought.

Jenna set up her blanket in the cave. She ate some more food and drank her water. Outside, rain began to fall. But Jenna was safe and dry.

In the morning, the storm had passed. Jenna continued her climb. By midday, she finally reached the top of the pass.

What a view! She could see for miles in every direction. And there, in the valley below, was her grandmother's village.

Jenna smiled. She had made it through the mountain pass. Now, it was all downhill to her grandmother's house.

As she started down the other side, Jenna felt proud. She had faced her fears and overcome big challenges. She couldn't wait to tell her grandmother about her adventure through the mountain pass.
