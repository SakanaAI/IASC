The Two Mountains

Long ago, in a green valley, there stood two mountains side by side. One mountain was tall and rocky, with a sharp peak that seemed to touch the sky. The other was shorter and rounder, with gentle slopes covered in trees and flowers.

The tall mountain was proud and boastful. It would often say to the shorter mountain, "Look how high I am! I can see farther than you ever will. The clouds rest on my peak, and the eagles make their nests in my cliffs."

The shorter mountain never argued. It was content with its forests and meadows, where animals played and plants grew in abundance.

One day, a group of people came to the valley. They were tired and hungry from their long journey. The tall mountain saw them first and called out, "Come to me! I am the greatest mountain in all the land. Climb my steep sides and stand on my peak!"

But the people looked at the tall mountain's sharp rocks and dangerous cliffs. They shook their heads and turned away.

Then the shorter mountain spoke softly, "You are welcome here. My slopes are gentle, and there is food and water for all."

The people smiled and began to climb the shorter mountain. They found fresh streams, fruit trees, and soft grass for resting. Soon, they built homes on its slopes and started a village.

As the years passed, the village grew into a town. The people on the shorter mountain lived happy lives, while the tall mountain remained empty and alone.

The tall mountain watched all this and felt sad. It finally understood that being the biggest or the highest didn't always make you the best.

One day, the tall mountain spoke to its neighbor. "I was wrong to boast," it said. "Your kindness and generosity have brought life and joy to this valley. I wish I had learned this lesson long ago."

The shorter mountain smiled. "It's never too late to change," it said. "Why don't you invite the birds to nest in your cliffs? Your rocks can provide homes for small animals too."

From that day on, the two mountains worked together. The tall mountain sheltered the valley from strong winds, while the shorter mountain provided food and water. The people in the town loved both mountains equally, and the valley became known as the happiest place in all the land.

And so, the two mountains learned that each had its own special gifts, and that by sharing those gifts, they could make the world a better place.
