The Green Frog

In a small pond at the edge of a forest lived a bright green frog named Hop. Hop was different from the other frogs. While they were brown or gray, his skin shone like a fresh leaf in the sun.

Every day, Hop would sit on his favorite lily pad and watch the world go by. He saw colorful birds flying overhead and fish swimming below. But Hop felt lonely. The other frogs didn't want to play with him because he looked different.

One day, a little girl named Lily came to the pond. She wore a pretty green dress and had a kind smile. When she saw Hop, her eyes lit up with joy.

"What a beautiful frog!" Lily exclaimed. She sat by the water's edge and talked to Hop. Even though he couldn't speak back, Hop felt happy to have a friend.

Lily visited the pond every day that summer. She would tell Hop stories and sometimes bring him tasty flies to eat. Hop looked forward to her visits and would hop closer to the shore when he saw her coming.

As the days went by, the other frogs noticed how special Hop was. They saw how Lily loved talking to him and how he seemed to understand her. Slowly, they started to include Hop in their games and songs.

By the end of summer, Hop had many friends. The other frogs learned that being different could be a good thing. Lily had shown them that Hop's unique color made him special, not strange.

When it was time for Lily to go back to school, she said goodbye to Hop. "I'll miss you, my green friend," she said with a smile. "But I'll be back next summer!"

Hop watched her go, feeling happy. He knew he would always have a special place in Lily's heart, just as she had in his. And now, he had frog friends too.

As the leaves turned orange and red, Hop settled onto his lily pad. He was no longer the lonely green frog. He was Hop, the frog who taught everyone that being different can be beautiful.
