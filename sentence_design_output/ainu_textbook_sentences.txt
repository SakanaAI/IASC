This is a monkshood.

Monkshood is a terrible one.

Do not touch it!

Look! There is a big bird there.

That bird is an owl.

Is that a kamuy, too?

Yes, it is. It is a great kamuy.

Isn't a crow a kamuy?

Crows and sparrows are all kamuys.

Crows eat corns, and sparrows eat rice, so aren't they bad ones?

Everything has their roles.

Where do you come from?

I come from Tokyo.

There are many things that I have not seen.

You can pick it up and see it.

What is this?

I want it.

This is something I cherish, so I don't sell it.

What is your name?

Your name is very good.

Is this knife your knife?

It is mine.

Is it good if I draw the knife?

Good, but the blade is sharp, so don't cut your finger.

Did you carve both sheath and the handle?

I did not carve it.

It's me who carved it.

My hand hurts because I worked hard today.

How did you hurt your hand?

My hand hurts because I was whittling bamboo to make arrows.

My waist hurts.

What did you do to hurt your waist?

My back hurts because I cut wood and made a mortar.

My legs went numb too.

What did you do for your legs to go numb?

I didn’t do anything, just sat all day, and my legs went numb.

Children, what are you doing?

We are fishing.

What did you fish?

We caught a dace, a trout, and a white-spotted char.

When you get home, are you going to eat these fish?

Before we go home, we plan to put them all back in the river.

Then, that's good.

Where are you going?

I am going to the city to buy food.

What do you want to eat this evening?

We want to eat meat!

Bears sleep in caves all through the winter.

Are the husband and wife together?

No, they're there one by one.
