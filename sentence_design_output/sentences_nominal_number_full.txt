Rationale for the sentence set:

1. I've provided an equal distribution of 10 sentences each for SINGULAR, DUAL, and PLURAL forms.
2. For SINGULAR, I used "a," "an," or "the" with singular nouns.
3. For DUAL, I consistently used "two" with plural nouns to indicate duality.
4. For PLURAL, I used various plural nouns without specifying a number.
5. I've included a variety of subjects and verbs to keep the sentences interesting and diverse.
6. Some sentences include irregular plurals (e.g., geese, oxen) to showcase different forms of plurality.
7. I've kept the sentences simple, using common words and straightforward structures.
8. Each sentence is unique and doesn't exceed 15 words.
9. The sentences cover a range of topics to maintain engagement and variety.

This set of sentences should effectively illustrate the concept of NUMBER in English nouns across SINGULAR, DUAL, and PLURAL forms.
